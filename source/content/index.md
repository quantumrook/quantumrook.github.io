A collection of thoughts from an undergraduate physics student interested in General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and Programming.

# Layout

## Notes and Thoughts

The [[Math/index|Math]] and [[Physics/index|Physics]] folders contain my version of notes from content learned in classes at Oregon State University and from reference texts listed in the [[Bibliography]].

## Projects

The [[Programming/index|Programming]] folder contains projects that I am currently working on, or have worked on in the past. Content ranges from my undergraduate thesis ([[Programming/Project-Cartographer/About|Project Cartographer]]) to a python & tkinter based weather forecast app ([[Programming/Project-Empyrean/About|Project Empyrean]]).

### Project Cartographer

### Project Empyrean

## Tutorials

A bit self descriptive. Here I plan on uploading and documenting the process of how you would go about learning various concepts, either through practical applications like Project Empyrean, or through exploratory concepts to further your understanding of programming and/or math/physics.
