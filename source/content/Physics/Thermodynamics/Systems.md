## State Parameters



## Properties

### Extensive

>[!summary] Definition:
>A property that depends on how much *stuff* you have; if you double the *stuff*, the property doubles. E.g., mass, Volume, Energy, Entropy.

### Intensive

>[!summary] Definition: 
>A property that is independent of how much *stuff* you have. E.g., density, Temperature, Pressure.

### Isothermal Compressibility
