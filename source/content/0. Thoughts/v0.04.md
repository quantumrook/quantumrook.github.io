List of outstanding work items:

- Handle escaped characters in pre-formatted blocks (code blocks)
	- probably need to skip over these in some of the formatting to avoid any false positives
- Embedding other notes
- Math support (most likely just using MathJax for the time being)

## Coffee Thoughts

Today's goal is to tackle the embedding of other notes, which is going to require some fundamental changes.

In theory, the *simplest(?)* way would be to somehow feed a list of markdown files to `md_to_html.py` in a sorted order: files that have no dependency go first, then the files that depended on them, and we're golden.

Assuming that `md_to_html.py` is provided this queue (regardless of how its constructed just yet) would mean that when it comes across an internal embed `![[ ]]`, we then need to go to the generated html file and snag everything between `<section>` tags.

This means the flow is something like:

1. Generate queue, sorted by no dependency (start) to dependencies (end)
2. Do the current process of conversion, including generating the `.html` file.
3. When an internal embed is found:
	1. Open up the matching `.html` file
	2. Find the `<section>` tags associated with the anchor
	3. copy that content
	4. splice that content into the file with the embed, replacing `![[ ]]` with `<section> {{content}} </section>`
	5. Continue as normal
4. Continue until the queue is empty

### Alternative

Since I already have the `{{ placeholder }}` syntax in use, I could replace `![[v0.03#Coffee Thoughts]]` with `{{ file: "v0.03.md" anchor: "Coffee-Thoughts" }}` and continue as normal.

Then before the script finishes, it does a pass on each generated `html` file searching for any remaining `{{ placeholder }}` and if it finds it, go search for the corresponding file and copy-paste.

The benefit here is that we don't have to worry about the order of markdown files being consumed by the script, but we do lose by having to re-read each file. This naturally then screams that some sort of flag should be triggered when it discovers the presence of the embed link, or just that the file name is added to a list, e.g.:

```python
if markdown_file.has_embed():
	files_with_embed.append(markdown_file)
```

I'm really fighting the desire to make a markdown file object: my gut says to do it because the complexity is growing beyond just passing around a `list[str]` but I don't know if I've actually reached the point where it would help. I mean, it might make some of the code a bit more clear?

### Considering a Markdown Class

```python
class MarkdownFile():
	def __init__(self, filename, filecontents):
		self.file_name = filename

		self.frontmatter = self.__splice_frontmatter(filecontents)
		self.body = self.__splice_body(filecontents)
```

I could actually have the class responsible for reading in the file contents from the `.md` and then instead of doing `file.readlines()`, I could read line by line and:

- splice the frontmatter in place
- append to the body as we go
- check for embeds while appending

Which would save me the extra cost of reading to find out if the file in question has any embeds. Of course, I could also just change the current file reading function to do the same thing right now, without the class.

### Super crazy thought

What if I converted the markdown into JSON first? What would that even look like?

I guess I'm just thinking more like a key-value pair for content blocks

```python
markdown_body = 
{
	"## This is H2" :
		{
			"content" : 
			[
				"Here's **some text**.\n",
				"\n",
				"I should **probably** get *some* ***lorem-ipsum*** in here.\n",
				"\n",
				"~~TODO: add lorem-ipsum~~\n",
				"Here's an [internal link](#this-is-h2) to the same file. And here's an [internal site](/Example2.md) link. Here's a [link](/Example2.md#other-h2) to a header in the other file.\n",
				"Now for the tricky part (?) let's link to the formatting [sheet](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax). And now an external image: ![Engelbart](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/images/Engelbart.jpg)\n"
			],
			"### Lorem Ipsum" :
			{
				"> [!note]" : "> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Cras ullamcorper eros at maximus porta. Vestibulum lectus metus, ornare nec suscipit at, sagittis vitae augue. Vestibulum sem velit, lobortis eu mattis nec, pulvinar ac metus. Nulla ex quam, gravida in efficitur vel, accumsan vitae lorem. In at malesuada mauris. Etiam id dui sit amet nisl efficitur fermentum. Nam mattis sapien eget dolor imperdiet suscipit. Phasellus tristique eleifend dolor nec ultrices. Fusce semper ex mollis risus vehicula fringilla. Vivamus commodo ut tortor vitae ultricies. Mauris consequat fermentum egestas. Nunc pulvinar mauris ipsum, a ornare massa consectetur eget.",
				#etc
			},
		},	 
}
```

I mean... it could be interesting, because then everything is already sectioned off, which would simplify the conversion functions -- since they would no longer have to do special logic for tracking if a block has started and where it ends.

The problem becomes: How do you know how far down to dig in this dictionary structure?

I guess at its extreme (not that I'll every use them), the deepest header level is 6: `######`, and then at that point you can figure out how deep you could nest things. I know there's a page on here that has a table inside a callout.

You can also nest callouts in callouts, but I don't know how deep you can go with that. I know I have at least one instance of a nested callout,

> > >3
> > > >4
> > > > >5
> > > > > >6
> > > > > > >7
> > > > > > > >8
> > > > > > > > >9
> > > > > > > > > >10
> > > > > > > > > > >11
> > > > > > > > > > > >12
> > > > > > > > > > > > >13
> > > > > > > > > > > > > >14
> > > > > > > > > > > > > > >15

> > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > >20
> > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > 21

Okay that's pretty insane that Obsidian apparently just allows infinite nesting of callouts. I think for sanity reasons I could probably cap it at 5, because at some point it just loses meaning and you probably should reevaluate how you're structuring your content on the page. The good news in this situation, is that Obsidian doesn't support headers in callouts, because that'd effectively start the whole process over again.

Of course the trick here is to come up with the logical and consistent way to structure the key-value pairs, but this is rather tempting... Especially when it comes to dealing with the embedded content, as I could just splice in the content super easily.

## The Nested Dictionary Approach: Post Mortem

The complexity of this probably should have been a bigger warning sign. Its even difficult to figure out where to start in explaining what I've done for the past couple days.

### Chunking content

So, the core idea was to create a structure where the key was the start of a *block* and the value was the corresponding *block*, e.g.

```python
def nest_subheadings_inside_headings(grouped_by_headers):
    headers = ['######', '#####', '####', '###', '##']
    headers.reverse()

    by_h2 = { }
    last_header = { }

    for header_key in list(grouped_by_headers.keys()):
        cleaned_key = header_key.split(" ")[0]
        last_header[cleaned_key] = header_key

        match cleaned_key:
            case "##":
                by_h2[header_key] = {"content" : grouped_by_headers[header_key]}
            case "###":
                by_h2[last_header["##"]][header_key] = {"content" : grouped_by_headers[header_key]}
            case "####":
                by_h2[last_header["##"]][last_header["###"]][header_key] = {"content" : grouped_by_headers[header_key]}
            case "#####":
                by_h2[last_header["##"]][last_header["###"]][last_header["####"]][header_key] = {"content" : grouped_by_headers[header_key]}
            case _:
                by_h2[last_header["##"]][last_header["###"]][last_header["####"]][last_header["#####"]][header_key] = {"content" : grouped_by_headers[header_key]}

    return by_h2
```

So, something like this snippet from `example.md`:

```markdown
## Table of Features Implemented

| Feature | Implemented |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Unordered Lists | Yes |
| Ordered Lists | Yes |
| Task Lists | Yes |
| images, internal | Yes |
| images, external | Yes |
| links, internal | Yes |
| links, external | Yes |
| links, embedded | No |
| Tables | Yes |
| Callouts | Yes |
| Code Blocks | Yes |
| Math | No |

![small banner](/content/small_banner.png)

## This is H2

Here's **some text**.

I should **probably** get *some* ***lorem-ipsum*** in here.

~~TODO: add lorem-ipsum~~

Here's an [internal link](#this-is-h2) to the same file. And here's an [internal site](/Example2.md) link. Here's a [link](/Example2.md#other-h2) to a header in the other file.

Now for the tricky part (?) let's link to the formatting [sheet](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax). And now an external image: ![Engelbart](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/images/Engelbart.jpg)

### Lorem Ipsum

> [!note]
> `~snip~`
```

would ultimately be parsed into the following dictionary:

```python
example_by_h2 = 
{
	"## Table of Features Implemented" : 
	{
		"content" : 
		[
			['| Feature | Implemented |', '| ------- | ----------- |', '| Unordered Lists | Yes |', '| Ordered Lists | Yes |', '| Task Lists | Yes |', '| images, internal | Yes |', '| images, external | Yes |', '| links, internal | Yes |', '| links, external | Yes |', '| links, embedded | No |', '| Tables | Yes |', '| Callouts | Yes |', '| Code Blocks | Yes |', '| Math | No |'],
			['![small banner](/content/small_banner.png)']
		]
	},
	"## This is H2" : 
	{
		"content" :
		[
			["Here's **some text**."],
			['I should **probably** get *some* ***lorem-ipsum*** in here.'],
		    ['~~TODO: add lorem-ipsum~~'],
		    ["Here's an [internal link](#this-is-h2) to the same file. And here's an [internal site](/Example2.md) link. Here's a [link](/Example2.md#other-h2) to a header in the other file."],
		    ["Now for the tricky part (?) let's link to the formatting [sheet](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax). And now an external image: ![Engelbart](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/images/Engelbart.jpg)"],
		],
		"### Lorem Ipsum" :
		{
			"content" :
			[
				['> [!note] \n', '> `~snip`'],
			],
		},
	},
}
```

Part of the power for this approach, is that it drastically simplified the logic for having `<section>` tags wrap around each section. The other benefit was that each *block* of content was contained in its own list, and it all came about from the simple realization: every *block* was separated by a line containing only `\n`.

> There is one exception to this, which is the nestable elements, such as lists and callouts

But this was a huge leap forward: I no longer had to have special rules in each of the handler modules for looking to see if we've started a block, are in a block, or finished a block. Most of it could've been standardized, but there's a bunch of edge cases for each different type of syntax that was causing a bunch of friction whenever I tried.

### The Promise

Anyways, this was basically exactly what I wanted when it came to dealing with embedded links. All I had to do was find the header for the corresponding file and I could just splice that into the embedded file.

So, we have the file `embedded_example.md`, whose contents are:

```markdown
---
title: "Embedded Example"
created: "2025-01-11"
modified:
    - "2025-01-11"
---

## Content from Example

This is an example of embedded content:

![[example#Now onto some code]]
```

Which means we need to get the *block* of content, from `example.md`, that falls under the header of `Now onto some code`.

In this simple example, that *should* be as straight forward as taking the line `![[example#Now onto some code]]` and replacing it with the key-value pair from `example_by_h2`:

```python
embedded_example_h2 = 
{
	"## Content from Example" : 
	{
		"content" :
		[
			['This is an example of embedded content:\n'],
			['![[example#Now onto some code]]\n']
		]
	}	
}
```

becomes:

```python
embedded_example_h2 = 
{
	"## Content from Example" : 
	{
		"content" :
		[
			['This is an example of embedded content:\n'],
			[
				"## Now onto some code" :
				{
					"content" :
					[
						['Here, we create a simple loop in python:'],
					    ['```python', '# before: start, stop, step', 'for i in range(start, stop, step):', '    f.integrate(i)', '```'],
					    ["Now let's step through this:"],
					    ['```', 'define start', 'define stop', 'define our step size', 'do numerical integration', '```'],
					]
				} 
			]
		]
	}	
}
```

### The Problem

So, in theory, this works out great, and in practice -before implementing the embedded logic- it handled the markdown to html conversion great.

This is where warning 2 should've kicked things off:

```python
def format_content(nested_blocks_of_content):
    html_content = ""
    for h2, h2_content in nested_blocks_of_content.items():
        h2_prefix, h2_indent, h2_suffix = get_block_wrapper(h2)
        h2_block = ""
        for h3, h3_content in h2_content.items():
            if h3 == "content":
                h2_block += format_block(h2_indent, h3_content)
            else:
                h3_prefix, h3_indent, h3_suffix = get_block_wrapper(h3)
                h3_block = ""
                for h4, h4_content in h3_content.items():
                    if h4 == "content":
                        h3_block += format_block(h3_indent, h4_content)
                    else:
                        h4_prefix, h4_indent, h4_suffix = get_block_wrapper(h4)
                        h4_block = ""
                        for h5, h5_content in h4_content.items():
                            if h5 == "content":
                                h4_block += format_block(h4_indent, h5_content)
                            else:
                                h5_prefix, h5_indent, h5_suffix = get_block_wrapper(h5)
                                h5_block = ""
                                for h6, h6_content in h5_content.items():
                                    if h6 == "content":
                                        h5_block += format_block(h5_indent, h6_content)
                                    else:
                                        h6_prefix, h6_indent, h6_suffix = get_block_wrapper(h6)
                                        h6_block = ""
                                        for sub_h6, sub_h6_content in h6_content.items():
                                            h6_block += format_block(h6_indent, sub_h6_content)
                                        h5_block += h6_prefix + h6_block + h6_suffix
                                h4_block += h5_prefix + h5_block + h5_suffix
                        h3_block += h4_prefix + h4_block + h4_suffix
                h2_block += h3_prefix + h3_block + h3_suffix
        html_content += h2_prefix + h2_block + h2_suffix

    return html_content
```

Because I'm supporting an arbitrary amount of nested headers, I have no way of knowing what the structure of `nested_blocks_of_content` looks like. Which means I have to unwrap this whole thing in order to do the formatting.

If this were a one off thing, I could probably live with it, but if you scroll back up to what `embedded_example_h2` became... I was in the situation where I might have to do this whole nested looping *again* - while already in the process of doing it.

And... that's just too much.

There's also a few problems with this approach, while logical, it requires a strict hierarchy of headers.

So something like:

```markdown
%%frontmatter stuff%%
---

Hi, I occasionally like to put text before headers.

## Now let's get started

Blah.
```

would fail. Now I can fix this by personally always starting each document with an h2 as the first bit of non-frontmatter content, however, that doesn't help with:

```
%%frontmatter stuff%%
---

### Summary

Here's a quick summary of the content coming up in this document.

## Now let's get started

Blah.
```

There's no h2 for that h3 to be nested inside. Again, I could probably fake it such that there's a special exemption for the first block of content.. but we're growing in even more complexity for an already monstrous process.

One more hole to blow in the sinking ship: The Markdown spec doesn't require you logically(?) nest headers, e.g.

```markdown

## I'm an H2

#### But I'm and H4
```

And, I don't have a problem with that, but the nested dictionary would freak out.

```python
example_by_h2["## I'm an H2"][???]["#### But I'm and H4"]
```

Basically, I'd need to have a placeholder h3 (or whatever header level) key to handle this.. and.. yeah, let's just let the ship sink at this point.

## Coffee Thoughts, pt. 2

I think my requirements are still roughly the same in that

- I want to be able to chunk a markdown file by section
- I need to easily access a chunk for embedding
- I need something that respects the hierarchy of the document

So, 

- nested dictionaries are out.
- a markdown class:
	- most likely the same issue in supporting a non-strict hierarchy
- a tree?

It's been a minute since I've implemented a tree from scratch, so this requires more thinking before I get started, but I think the basic implementation will work:

- each node is a section
	- has the section name
	- has a branch for each child section
	- has its own content

I'm wondering if the parent should also know who its children are, so I can have a toplevel function that I can call when I'm searching for the relevant section to embed, instead of having to walk through the tree until I find it, and then remember the path.

And while I'm at it, I could probably have a flag property on the node, such that during construction (since I'm reading through everything): if we find an embedded link, set that flag to true.

Optionally, instead of it just being a boolean, I could have it save the file name and section name, so I don't have to rewalk when I'm going to handle embeds.

## The Tree Approach

Okay, so with all that in mind, let's get started. Now, the general implementation would have a lot of extra functionality that we can ultimately omit because we are only supporting a very specific use case and know how the data will be structured.

```python
  class MarkdownNode():

    def __init__(self, block_data, block_name):
        self.children = [ ]
        self.block_data = block_data
        self.block_name = block_name

    def get_branch_name(self):
        branch_names = [ ]
        if not self.children:
            return [self.block_name]
        for child in self.children:
            for child_name in child.get_branch_name():
                branch_names.append(f"{self.block_name} -> {child_name}")
        return branch_names


h2 = MarkdownNode("Lorem Ipsum would be over kill", "h2")
h3 = MarkdownNode("Here are two reasons why", "h3")
h2.children.append(h3)


h4a = MarkdownNode("Reason 1", "h4a")
h4b = MarkdownNode("Reason 2", "h4b")

h3.children.append(h4a)
h3.children.append(h4b)

print(h2.get_branch_name())
```

which gives the expected output of:

```python
['h2 -> h3 -> h4a', 'h2 -> h3 -> h4b']
```

The next thing that would be useful is probably a `collapse_branch()` function that does a similar thing to the `get_branch_name()`, but returns the content instead. 

Or...

I could start with a `get_content_for_branch(branch_name)`, and that looks something like:

```python
    def get_content_for_branch_name(self, branch_name):
        if branch_name == self.block_name:
            return self.block_data

        this_branch_names = self.get_branch_name()
        not_found = True

        for this_branch in this_branch_names:
            print(this_branch)
            if branch_name in this_branch:
                not_found = False

        if not_found:
            return ""

        for child in self.children:
            child_answer = child.get_content_for_branch_name(branch_name)
            if child_answer:
                return child_answer
```

which, testing with

```python
print(h2.get_content_for_branch_name("h4b"))
```

gives

```
h2 -> h3 -> h4a
h2 -> h3 -> h4b
h3 -> h4a
h3 -> h4b
h4a
Reason 2
```

Nice.

I should then be able to do a similar approach for setting content, which will make handling the embedding part a lot easier. 

```python
    def set_content_for_branch_name(self, branch_name, branch_data):
        if branch_name == self.block_name:
            self.block_data = branch_data

        this_branch_names = self.get_branch_name()
        not_found = True

        for this_branch in this_branch_names:
            if branch_name in this_branch:
                not_found = False

        if not_found:
            return ""

        for child in self.children:
            child.set_content_for_branch_name(branch_name, branch_data)
```

Yep, pretty much a copy-paste.

```python
print(h4a.block_data)
h2.set_content_for_branch_name("h4a", "I've been replaced!")
print(h4a.block_data)
```

Gives:

```
Reason 1
I've been replaced!
```

Now I think its time to hook up the example files and see what it looks like.... But that requires me to redo the *chopping of content blocks*.

### Setting up Tests

I've been procrastinating by reading various tech blogs, and one in particular was about [rqlite](https://philipotoole.com/how-is-rqlite-tested/). While the tech doesn't apply here, the write up on how the dev has maintained the codebase has triggered the thought:

I'm basically doing manual tests of my code base with these example files already... so why not formalize the process with unit tests?

I mean, in that sense, I'm already doing it, but I have to manually check the output versus expectations to make sure changes/fixes didn't break anything else... so why not actually benefit from a test suite?

My exposure to writing unit tests is rather limited, and I don't think I've done them in python before, so this might take a minute to get set up.

..

I might not have the best way for testing each case done correctly, but from what I can see, I now have coverage for:

- chopping the body into a tree of nodes 
	- with no frontmatter present
	- with frontmatter present
	- with multiple levels, some repeated (per the `nested_example.md` file)
	- with horizontal rules present (per the `no_frontmatter.md` file)

And that gives a lot more confidence for what comes next... ~~Revisiting embeddings~~

Just kidding, I still need to chunk content into blocks for things like preformatted text and callouts.

### Preformatted Blocks

So first thing on the agenda was to handle the situation where the section header logic was trigger off the sample python code block, that looked like:

```python
# before: start, stop, step
for i in range(start, stop, step):
    f.integrate(i)
```

Took a bit of thinking, but the approach I decided to go with was to "clean" the list of section indices. For reference, I used a list comprehension like so:

```python
block_signals = ['# ', '## ', '### ', '#### ', '##### ', '###### ', '---']

indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(body) for y in block_signals if x.startswith(y)]
```

So, generating the list of what to ignore follows the same pattern:

```python
indices_to_ignore = [i for i, x in enumerate(body) if x.startswith('```')]
```

And since the preformatted blocks come in pairs, we can use the so often ignored parameter of `range` to specify a non-one step size:

```python
cleaned_indices = [ ]
for index in indices:
	found_issue = False
	for i in range(0, len(indices_to_ignore), 2):
		start = indices_to_ignore[i]
		stop = indices_to_ignore[i+1]
		if index > start and index < stop:
			found_issue = True

	if not found_issue:
		cleaned_indices.append(index)

indices = cleaned_indices
```

There's probably a better way to do this, but I found using a flag, `found_issue`, to be necessary for blocking the index from being added to the new list. Basically, say `index=76` was the problematic one (the comment in the python block). So, start and stop would come along with `75` and `79` (i think? the specifics aren't super critical). `76` is between `75` and `79`, so we'd skip over adding the index, but, there's more than one preformatted block in `indices_to_ignore`, and then `75` is less than the `start` of the next one... and problem.

So, the 'setting of the flag' approach fixed that. I'll have to look later if there's a clever list comprehension that lets you filter out items like this use case.

Now that we have a nice clean list of indices, we can slice up the `body` into the content associated with each section:

```python
content_indices = [ ]
for i, index in enumerate(indices):
	if i+1 == len(indices):
		content_indices.append((index+1, len(body)))
	else:
		content_indices.append((index+1, indices[i+1]-1))

for start, stop in content_indices:
	block_of_content.append(body[start:stop])
```

> Now that I'm writing this bit up, I realize... I could just do the splicing of body in the first loop - I don't need to iterate twice.

*Ahem*

```python
for i, index in enumerate(indices):
	if i+1 == len(indices):
		block_of_content.append(body[index+1:len(body)])
	else:
		block_of_content.append(body[index+1:indices[i+1]-1])
```

That's much better.

So the index corresponds to section header, so that's why we increment by one for the start of the splice, and as long as we're not at the end of the document, we want to look ahead in the list of indices (by one step) and then grab the line *before* that section header.

In theory, now we have everything we need in order to start creating nodes and assigning parents and the content... except, I documents are rarely going to just flow from one header level to the next lowest - they will, more often than not, be structured like this one:

- H2: Coffee Thoughts
	- H3: Alternative
	- H3: Considering a Markdown Class
	- H3: Super crazy thought
- H2: The Nested Dictionary Approach: Post Mortem
	- etc...


And so I figured I needed two bits of information: 

- a numeric representation of the header level

and

- the last node for each level

Both of these come about from being able to support things like:

- H1
	- H2
		- H3
			- H4
	- H2

and/or

- H2
	- H3
		- H4
		- ---
	- H3

The first thing to do was to actually find out which section headers are present in the document, and it wasn't until later that I realized I wanted to do this using the *cleaned indices* (I was getting a false positive from the python code block):

```python
section_headers = [ ]
for index in indices:
	section_headers.append(body[index])

header_levels_present = [y for x in section_headers for y in block_signals if x.startswith(y)]
header_levels_present = list(dict.fromkeys(header_levels_present))
```

This builds an *ordered* list (with repeats removed) of all types of section headers present in the document. Next, we fill out the dictionary:

```python
name_map = {
	"---" : -1,
	"article" : 0,
}

level_counter = 1
for header_level in header_levels_present:
	if header_level.strip() not in name_map:
		name_map[header_level.strip()] = level_counter
		level_counter += 1
```

which, for `example.md` ends up looking like:

```python
name_map = {
	"---" : -1,
	"article" : 0,
	"##" : 1,
	"###" : 2,
	"####" : 3,
}
```

And now we get to the complicated bit:

```python
last_node = article_node
last_node_at_level = { 0 : article_node }

for i, index in enumerate(indices):
	node_name = body[index].strip()
	node_level = name_map[node_name.split(" ")[0]]
	last_node_level = name_map[last_node.block_name.split(" ")[0]]

	if last_node_level == -1:
		last_node = last_node_at_level[node_level -1]
		node = MarkdownNode(node_name, block_of_content[i], last_node)

	elif node_level > last_node_level:
		node = MarkdownNode(node_name, block_of_content[i], last_node)

	elif node_level == last_node_level or node_level == -1:
		node = MarkdownNode(node_name, block_of_content[i], last_node.parent)

	else:
		last_node = last_node_at_level[node_level -1]
		node = MarkdownNode(node_name, block_of_content[i], last_node)

	last_node = node
	last_node_at_level[node_level] = last_node
```

So, at the start of the loop, we get some key information:

- First, strip off the new line character and any extra whitespace and that's our node's name: e.g. "## This is H2"
- Next, we find out what level this section corresponds to (that's using our `name_map` dictionary we created above)
- Then, we want to figure out what level the previous node was

Once we have that, we have four situations:

- 1: The last node was a horizontal rule
	- This means we need to go up one level compared to ours, and that's our parent.
	- That's the H2 -> H3 -> H4, ---, H3 case from above. We want that second H3's parent to be H2.
- 2: Our level is greater than the previous node
	- This is the easiest: we're the child of the previous node.
- 3: We are the same level as the previous
	- We share the parent node of the previous node
- 4: Our level is less than the previous node
	- This is like being another H2 after adding sections to a different H2

And then finally, we overwrite the `last_node` with what we just created.

There's probably a clever trick I can do to group/simplify the logic from four cases down, but it escapes me at this time. And the test function that made keeping track of all this sane is:

```python
def test_chunking_body_with_callouts(self):
	lines = [ ]
	with open(test_paths["full_suite"], "r") as file:
		lines = file.readlines()

	frontmatter, body = handlers.chopper.separate_frontmatter_from_body(lines)
	chunked_body = handlers.chopper.chop_body_into_nodes(body)

	article = MarkdownNode("article", "", None)
	h2_1 = MarkdownNode("## Table of Features Implemented", "", article)
	h2_2 = MarkdownNode("## This is H2", "", article)
	h3_1 = MarkdownNode("### Lorem Ipsum", "", h2_2)
	h3_2 = MarkdownNode("### Lists", "", h2_2)
	h4_1 = MarkdownNode("#### But in order:", "", h3_2)
	hr = MarkdownNode("---", "", h3_2)
	h2_3 = MarkdownNode("## Now onto some code", "", article)


	print("Test built:")
	print(article.get_branch_name())
	print("\nFunction built:")
	print(chunked_body.get_branch_name())

	found_matches = [ ]
	for test_branch_name in article.get_branch_name():
		for method_branch_name in chunked_body.get_branch_name():
			if test_branch_name == method_branch_name:
				found_matches.append(True)

	self.assertEqual(len(found_matches), len(article.get_branch_name()))
```

Without this, I think there would be a number of bugs hiding in the logic that I'd slowly find and have to track overtime and... yeah, testing is great. This also gives me the confidence to clean up that big function of `chop_body_into_nodes` into a series of smaller functions, so its easier to follow.

I'll save you the copy-paste of the refactoring, but the gist is that its now structured like:

```python
def chop_body_into_nodes(body: list[str]) -> MarkdownNode:
    section_header_indices = __get_section_indices(body)
    section_content = __get_section_content(section_header_indices, body)
    section_name_map = __get_section_name_to_level_map(body, section_header_indices)

    article_node = MarkdownNode("article", None, None)
    last_node = article_node
    last_node_at_level = { 0 : article_node }

    for i, index in enumerate(section_header_indices):
        node_name = body[index].strip()
        node_level = section_name_map[node_name.split(" ")[0]]
        last_node_level = section_name_map[last_node.block_name.split(" ")[0]]

        if last_node_level == -1:
            last_node = last_node_at_level[node_level -1]
            node = MarkdownNode(node_name, section_content[i], last_node)
        elif node_level > last_node_level:
            node = MarkdownNode(node_name, section_content[i], last_node)
        elif node_level == last_node_level or node_level == -1:
            node = MarkdownNode(node_name, section_content[i], last_node.parent)
        else:
            last_node = last_node_at_level[node_level -1]
            node = MarkdownNode(node_name, section_content[i], last_node)

        last_node = node
        last_node_at_level[node_level] = last_node

    return article_node
```

## Formatting, Again

One of the things I talked about in the previous versions was how similar but annoying the formatting code was. With the previous implementation, most of the syntaxes had to have their own function, because they all had slightly different ways of doing things. At the end of the day though, they all follow the same basic flow:

```python
def handle_callouts(markdown_body: list[str]) -> list[str]:

    for syntax_name, syntax_value in markdown_syntax.items():
        html_start, html_end = html_syntax[syntax_name]
        markdown_body = __handle_syntax(markdown_body, syntax_value, html_start, html_end)

    return markdown_body
```

And then `__handle_syntax()` would look something like:

```python
block_started = False
callout_type = ""

for i, line in enumerate(markdown_body):
	callout_match = re.search(r'^> ', line)
	callout_name = re.search(r'^>\s\[\!(?P<callout_type>[\S]*)\]\s', line)
	callout_content = re.search(r'^>\s(?P<content>.*)', line)

	if callout_match is None:
		if block_started:
			markdown_body[i] = "</blockquote></div>\n"
			block_started = False
		continue

	if not block_started:
		block_started = True
		if callout_name is not None:
			markdown_body[i] = re.sub(r'^>\s\[\!(?P<callout_type>[\S]*)\]\s', r'<div id="callout-\g<callout_type>"><blockquote>', line)
		else:
			markdown_body[i] = re.sub(r'^> ', '<div id="callout"><blockquote>\n\t', line) + "<br />"
	elif callout_content is not None:
		markdown_body[i] = "\t" + callout_content.group(1) + "<br />"

	if (i+1) == len(markdown_body):
		markdown_body[i] += "\n</blockquote></div>"

return markdown_body
```

Now, the more you look at it, the more you'll probably notice things like:

- I've hardcoded the markdown syntax
- I'm not using `html_start` and `html_end` to wrap the content
- its not great

But, if we look past the details a bit, you can see the pattern:

- create a flag for denoting if a block has been started
- iterate over the content
	- use regex to see if the formatting element is present in the line of content
	- if it is, start a block
	- replace the markdown syntax with html
	- if we've started a block and regex didn't find anything: end the block

What I want to do this time, is have a general `__handle_syntax` function that works for everything, and I think I know how to get away with it (and tests are going to help). However, like with chunking the content, I have a few possibilities on how to approach this.

#### Possibility 1: Classes

You can tell its a crude mock-up based on the naming...

```python
class BaseThing():

    def __init__(self, markdown: str, regex: str, html_start: str, html_end: str):
        self.markdown = markdown
        self.regex = regex
        self.html_start = html_start
        self.html_end = html_end

class BlockThing(BaseThing):

    def __init__(self, markdown, regex, html_start, html_end, html_block_start, html_block_end):
        super().__init__(markdown, regex, html_start, html_end)
        self.block_start = html_block_start
        self.block_end = html_block_end

bold = BaseThing(
    markdown= "**",
    regex= r'\*{2}(?P<content[^*]*)\*{2}',
    html_start= "<b>",
    html_end= "</b>"
)

unnamed_callout = BlockThing(
    markdown= ">",
    regex=r'^>\s(?P<content>.*)',
    html_start= "<p>",
    html_end="</p>",
    html_block_start= '<div id="callout"><blockquote>',
    html_block_end= '</blockquote></div>'
)
```

#### Possibility 2: A big ol' Map

```python
markdown_regex_html_map = {
    "bold" : {
        "regex_find" : r'\*{2}(?P<content[^*]*)\*{2}',
        "regex_replace" : r'<b>\g<content></b>'
    },

    "unnamed_callout" : {
        "regex_find" : r'^>\s(?P<content>.*)',
        "regex_replace" : r'<div id="callout">\n<blockquote>\n\g<content>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n'
    }
}
```

#### Possibility 3: Separate Dictionaries

```python
markdown_regex_map = {
    "bold" : r'\*{2}(?P<content[^*]*)\*{2}',
    "unnamed_callout" : r'^>\s(?P<content>.*)',
}


html_regex_map = {
    "bold" : [
        r'<b>',
        r'</b>'
    ],

    "unnamed_callout" : [
        r'<div id="callout">\n<blockquote>\n',
        r'</blockquote>\n</div>\n'
    ]

}
```

### Weighing the options

In the simplest use case, I think Possibility 2 would be the easiest to use:

- the first entry for a format element gives the regex to find it
- the second entry has the regex to replace without any extra fussing about

Cons:

- I'm pretty sure I'll have to rework the regex for handling blocks and that might not be possible?

Possibility 1:

- the defined structure makes it really hard to make mistakes when creating them
- and also makes it clear what you're getting with the properties when you're using them
- I *might* be able to dynamically create the regex search string on the fly, which means I can easily support the different syntax options for things like bold, e.g. `**` or `__`

Cons:

- its kinda overkill? or at least feels that way

Possibility 3:

- similar to possibility 2, but more flexible

### The goal

Just to give you an idea, the ideal situation is to ultimately have something like this:

```python
for i, line in enumerate(block_of_content):

	element_match = re.search(syntax_md, line)

	if element_match is None:
		if block_started:
			block_of_content[i-1] += html_block_end
			block_started = False
		continue
	
	element_content = element_match.group(1)
	
	if not block_started:
		block_started = True
		block_of_content[i] = html_block_start + html_start + element_content + html_end
	else:
		block_of_content[i] = html_start + element_content + html_end	
```

---

I was really hoping to avoid having to build any of the possibilities out until I knew which one was going to best align with what I wanted to do, but I think I have to see it in action before I can make the final call.

..

So I had to take a detour to get the testing to use the nodes, so I could make sure everything was working as intended. I didn't hit the goal of "the one true function", partially because of procrastination and partially because I just kinda want to get past this chunk and actually get it working.

As a result, testing kind of moved back to more manual: running the program, checking the output in the `.html` files. At this point, I'm *finally* back to where we started with the Nested Dictionaries.

## Embedding

This feature is somehow the bane of my existence. 

Okay, dramatic take aside, there's two ways I see about handling this:

1. Before formatting
2. After formatting

> Option 1: Before
>
> In theory, this should be the easiest, because we just scan for `![[ ]]` and then need to replace with content from the corresponding file.
>
> And then just run the formatting on everything.

>Option 2: After
>
> Actually, this might be as easy as the first, but we will have to format after splicing it in.

..

Looks like Option 2 was the way to go.

The implementation leaves a bit to be desired, but it does work, at least enough to the point where I can test it on these files and see what is broken and what isn't.
