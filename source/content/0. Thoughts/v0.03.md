List of outstanding features:
- external links
- images
- internal links (wiki-style)
- horizontal rule
- code blocks
- footnotes
- [advanced stylings](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Advanced+formatting+syntax)

## Coffee Thoughts:

- Since external links don't necessarily end in `.html`, I probably need to parse the link inside `[display text](here_is_a_link)` and see if it ends in a graphic file format. The quick and dirty way is to see if it is a `.png` since all my screenshots and images so far are `.png`.
	- External links are also going to start with `http`/`https`
	- 
- images also use the `!` prefix, e.g.: `![alt text](example.png)`
	- `![small banner](/QuantumRook_smaller_Banner.png)` produces: ![small banner](/QuantumRook_smaller_Banner.png)
- Internal links:
	- links are going to be relative paths: `[v0.02](/0.%20Thoughts/v0.02)` [v0.02](/0.%20Thoughts/v0.02)
	- wikilink style: `[[v0.02|Display text]]`: [[v0.02|Display text]]
	- need support for linking content from internal references, such as `![[Bibliography#Books]]`: ![[Bibliography#Books]]

## Order of Work

1. add horizontal rule support: any `---` after the front matter should be converted to `<hr />`
2. add anchors to header elements: `### Order of work` -> `<h3>Order of Work</h3>` needs to become `<h3 id="order-of-work">Order of work</h3>`
	1. Wrap content underneath a header using `<section class="h#">` where `h#` is the header level.
	2. Will make cross-note embeds easier: just only copy the html in the relevant section
	3. `### Order of work\n Some text below.` would become:  
```html
<section class="h3">
<h3 id="order-of-work">Order of work</h3>
<p>Some text below</p>
</section>
```
3. external link support: 
	1. convert `[display text](external link)` to `<a href="external link">display text</a>` 
4. image support
	1. convert `![alt text](internal image link)` to `<img src="internal image link" alt="alt text" />`
	2. future: support custom sizing of the image with CSS
5. internal link support
	1. convert `[display text](internal link)` to `<a href="internal link">display text</a>`
	2. convert `[[internal link|display text]]` to `<a href="internal link">display text</a>`
	3. figure out how to handle cross-note embeds `![[internal link]]`
		- find the html file and just wrap the section in a `<div id="callout"><blockquote>`?

## Horizontal Rule

Starting off easy this morning: This should be as straight forward as searching for any line whose content is just `---`, and since we've already sliced away the frontmatter, any instance of this is a `<hr />`

Hmm... we might want to ensure that a section ends when it sees the `<hr />`, but I need to add sections first.

## Sections and Header changes

Rewriting the function to use the same logic from the `styling.py` was fairly straight forward. To avoid the lists logic from grabbing the tag, I changed the order to have headers go later in the parsing stage - which should be okay, as nothing else is keying of hashes.

An interesting decision point has occurred though:

>- Do I want to end all sections when I see a `<hr />`?
>- What do I want `<hr />` to represent?

The first part is the easiest to do, as its as simple as checking to see if we've started a section already, and then run into a `<hr />` line. But the second part is the interesting question?

Do I want to use the horizontal rule to represent that there's essentially different content below? How does that meaningfully differ between using headers of the appropriate level?

Currently the only two places I can think of where I use the horizontal rule is the main page and the [[Bibliography]].

- on the main page, its used as a visual divider between the short description of what the site is and the content to follow, see [[index]].
	- There, its clearly acting as a "there's a difference in content/context"
- on the bibliography page, I'm using it as divider between distinct items
	- ![[Bibliography]]
	- in this case, I wouldn't want the "book's section" to end

I was originally (per [[v0.03#Coffee Thoughts]]) thinking of using the `<hr />` to denote when to stop an embedded note's content, but since I've added the section tags for each header level, I can just break on the `</section>`.

I think for now, I'll actually ignore the `<hr />` when searching for the end of a section, and leave it as a purely visual indicator for when content/context is switching.

## Image Links

Okay, this is definitely going to require regex, and fortunately, there's sites like: [this one](https://regex101.com/) that let you build and test your regex. Which means its a lot easier to find the pattern of:

"contains 1\[, then letters or digits, then 1\], then 1\( letters or digits then 1\)"

or in regex:

```
\[{1}([^\[]*)\]{1}\({1}([^\)]*)\){1}
```

better explained:

- `\[{1}`: look for exactly one instance of `[`
- `([^\[]*)`: then allow any characters except for `[`
- `\]{1}`: then look for exactly one `]`
- immediately following that needs to be 1 `(`
- allow any number of characters except `)`
- end with one `)`

So, we should be able to have anything like:

`!@#$%^&{}a-zA-Z _ 0-9 [<!@#$%^&{}a-zA-Z _ 0-9 >](<!@#$%^&{}a-zA-Z _ 0-9 >) !@#$%^&{}a-zA-Z _ 0-9 `

But what currently doesn't work is something like:

`[Fetch your own forecast!](/Tutorials/Fetching%20your%20own%20Forecast%20(IPython)/index.md)`

Because of the nested `( )` in the link. Luckily, we can drop the `[^\)]` requirement and it'll adjust on the fly. So the current working regex is now:

```regex
\[{1}([^\[]*)\]{1}\({1}(.*)\){1}
```

`[Fetch your [own] forecast!](/Tutorials/Fetching%20your%20own%20Forecast%20(IPython)/index.md)`

Which means we should be able to handle that nested `[ ]` as well, and it does beautifully:

```regex
\[{1}(.*)\]{1}\({1}(.*)\){1}
```

That's a lot better than having to get really specific with the sequencing.

---

All that being said, we probably need to handle the image and internal references first, the ones that have the `!` prefix.

And... I just discovered the `substitute` functionality for regexes... This is going to make things *so* much easier.

That being said, I now need to refactor the `styling.py` code, as the current implementation is seeing the `_` in the link:

```
![small banner](/content/small_banner.png)
```

and replacing it with an `<i>` tag.

But overall, this'll be a good thing, because I can now replace while I'm matching instead of iterating the body of text twice. It's still hardcoded right now, but look how much simpler this is:

```python
def __handle_syntax(markdown_body: list[str], syntax_md: str, html_start: str, html_end: str) -> list[str]:
    for i, line in enumerate(markdown_body):
        markdown_body[i] = re.sub(syntax_md, '<img src="..\\g<link>" alt="\\g<alttext>" />', line)
    return markdown_body
```

compared to:

```python
def __handle_syntax(markdown_body, syntax_md, html_start, html_end) -> list[str]:
    syntax_length = len(syntax_md)
    for line_index, line in enumerate(markdown_body):
        start_of_block = True
        if syntax_md in line:
            words = line.split(" ")
            for i, word in enumerate(words):
                if syntax_md in word:
                    prefix = word.strip()[:syntax_length]
                    suffix = word.strip()[-syntax_length:]
                    if prefix == syntax_md and suffix == syntax_md:
                        words[i] = html_start + word[syntax_length:].replace(syntax_md, html_end)
                    elif start_of_block:
                        words[i] = word.replace(syntax_md, html_start)
                        start_of_block = False
                    else:
                        words[i] = word.replace(syntax_md, html_end)
                        start_of_block = True
            markdown_body[line_index] = " ".join(words)
    return markdown_body
```


## Conversion Woes

Attempting to overhaul everything to use regex is actually a bit more complicated, at least with using the above loop style. One thing I miss from scanning ahead to get a list of indices, is that it is much harder to detect when I'm in a block of something, like the lists for example.

In the interest of making progress, I'll shelve the full switch to regex until later and work on continuing to get functionality implemented.

## Internal and External Links

For the time being I'm treating any link of the form `![]()` as an image, and then I'll go back and add in specific checking for image types. A lot of that complexity will come about from figuring out how to handle those internal embeds, since I kind of need to read in multiple files and I don't have an explicit way to check dependencies yet.

..

Yeesh, the regex get's a bit complicated to check for each pattern, and the way its set up requires a specific order:

- handle internal images
- handle external images
- links to the same file
- links to another file on the site
- links to a part of another file on the site
- external links

Since I do build up in complexity, I could probably do some string formatting to build each regex, but then you'd lose the ability to *easily* read what each regex is looking for -- I guess more realistically, the ability to easily copy-paste the regex to understand its filtering.

So, that means everything is support link wise except for the embedding and I might kick that can until tomorrow, because I think its going to require a more complicated data object to interact with than just a list of strings.

> I might need a separate script that runs first to build out a tree of dependencies for the embedded content, and then generate each file in the tree, walking from root to each leaf.

## Code blocks

...I'm going to need some coffee before I stare at this for a while...

Okay, this one actually doesn't seem too bad, but extra styling is probably going to create a headache. The simple version is to wrap any preformatted text, like:

```
here's an example
of
multiline preformatted text
```

in

```html
<pre><code class="">
here's an example
of
multiline preformatted text
</code></pre>
```

The idea is to take the first line content (when declaring a preformatted block) and use that for the class name to (in the future) do syntax highlighting, e.g.:

```
\```python
i = 1 + 1
```

into

```html
<pre><code class="python">
i = 1 + 1
</code></pre>
```

Now I need to handle escaping special HTML characters inside the code blocks... The documentation specifies that `<`, `>`, `&`, and `"` need to be replaced with their escaped version. 

But, I guess this is going to set the ground work for eventually wrapping reserved keywords for languages in `<span>` elements, so I can do syntax highlighting.

---

Took a little bit of reworking, and diving into CSS to see if the output was actually helpful, but basic syntax highlighting is support for python now. Which means, I can either:

- work on tackling embeds

or

- start on the advanced formatting:
	- tables
	- math

I think I'm going to go take my dog for a walk, tackle tables and see what code needs to be cleaned up and leave embeds and math expressions for v0.04.

..

Just kidding, fixed the blocking of callouts to work similar to the code blocks so custom CSS can be used for each different type. Now onto tables!

## Tables

Yeesh, this one was tricky to wrap my head around. So, to recap, markdown tables are formatted something like:

```markdown
| Feature | Implemented |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Unordered Lists | Yes |
| Ordered Lists | Yes |
| Task Lists | Yes |
| images, internal | Yes |
| images, external | Yes |
| links, internal | Yes |
| links, external | Yes |
| links, embedded | No |
| Tables | In progress |
| Callouts | Yes |
| Code Blocks | Yes |
| Math | No |
```

which actually leads to a very simple regex pattern: "Look for `|`, then grab the stuff after it, stopping at the next `|`".

We secretly want to do it this way, because we can run the search multiple times on each line to grab each column's contents. Now why do we want to do that? Because of how HTML tables are structured:

```html
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col"> Feature </th>
			<th scope="col"> Implemented </th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td> Unordered Lists </td>
		<td> Yes </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> Ordered Lists </td>
		<td> Yes </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> Task Lists </td>
		<td> Yes </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> images, internal </td>
		<td> Yes </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> images, external </td>
		<td> Yes </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> links, internal </td>
		<td> Yes </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> links, external </td>
		<td> Yes </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> links, embedded </td>
		<td> No </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> Tables </td>
		<td> In progress </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> Callouts </td>
		<td> Yes </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> Code Blocks </td>
		<td> Yes </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> Math </td>
		<td> No </td>
	</tr>
</table>
```

Which, you'll notice, pairs perfectly with grabbing each column's contents one at a time. The hard part, as seems to be the theme with this project, was figuring out:

- Are we in a table block?
	- Yes: start the table
- Have we taken care of the headers?
	- No: do the special syntax for the header row
	- Yes:
		- Have we eaten the line containing nothing but alignment information?
			- No: eat it
			- Yes: Make a table row

You get the gist. Later on, I'll need to go back and *not* just eat the alignment row, but somehow pass that on to how the columns should be aligned, but I'm definitely kicking that can down the road for now: which I can get away with, since I always center align my table content.

And that's a wrap for v0.03, at least in terms of new features.
