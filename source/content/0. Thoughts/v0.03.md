List of outstanding features:
- external links
- images
- internal links (wiki-style)
- horizontal rule
- code blocks
- footnotes
- [advanced stylings](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Advanced+formatting+syntax)

## Coffee Thoughts:

- Since external links don't necessarily end in `.html`, I probably need to parse the link inside `[display text](here_is_a_link)` and see if it ends in a graphic file format. The quick and dirty way is to see if it is a `.png` since all my screenshots and images so far are `.png`.
	- External links are also going to start with `http`/`https`
	- 
- images also use the `!` prefix, e.g.: `![alt text](example.png)`
	- `![small banner](/QuantumRook_smaller_Banner.png)` produces: ![small banner](/QuantumRook_smaller_Banner.png)
- Internal links:
	- links are going to be relative paths: `[v0.02](/0.%20Thoughts/v0.02)` [v0.02](/0.%20Thoughts/v0.02)
	- wikilink style: `[[v0.02|Display text]]`: [[v0.02|Display text]]
	- need support for linking content from internal references, such as `![[Bibliography#Books]]`: ![[Bibliography#Books]]

## Order of Work

1. add horizontal rule support: any `---` after the front matter should be converted to `<hr />`
2. add anchors to header elements: `### Order of work` -> `<h3>Order of Work</h3>` needs to become `<h3 id="order-of-work">Order of work</h3>`
	1. Wrap content underneath a header using `<section class="h#">` where `h#` is the header level.
	2. Will make cross-note embeds easier: just only copy the html in the relevant section
	3. `### Order of work\n Some text below.` would become:  
```html
<section class="h3">
<h3 id="order-of-work">Order of work</h3>
<p>Some text below</p>
</section>
```
3. external link support: 
	1. convert `[display text](external link)` to `<a href="external link">display text</a>` 
4. image support
	1. convert `![alt text](internal image link)` to `<img src="internal image link" alt="alt text" />`
	2. future: support custom sizing of the image with CSS
5. internal link support
	1. convert `[display text](internal link)` to `<a href="internal link">display text</a>`
	2. convert `[[internal link|display text]]` to `<a href="internal link">display text</a>`
	3. figure out how to handle cross-note embeds `![[internal link]]`
		- find the html file and just wrap the section in a `<div id="callout"><blockquote>`?

## Horizontal Rule

Starting off easy this morning: This should be as straight forward as searching for any line whose content is just `---`, and since we've already sliced away the frontmatter, any instance of this is a `<hr />`

Hmm... we might want to ensure that a section ends when it sees the `<hr />`, but I need to add sections first.

## Sections and Header changes

Rewriting the function to use the same logic from the `styling.py` was fairly straight forward. To avoid the lists logic from grabbing the tag, I changed the order to have headers go later in the parsing stage - which should be okay, as nothing else is keying of hashes.

An interesting decision point has occurred though:

>- Do I want to end all sections when I see a `<hr />`?
>- What do I want `<hr />` to represent?

The first part is the easiest to do, as its as simple as checking to see if we've started a section already, and then run into a `<hr />` line. But the second part is the interesting question?

Do I want to use the horizontal rule to represent that there's essentially different content below? How does that meaningfully differ between using headers of the appropriate level?

Currently the only two places I can think of where I use the horizontal rule is the main page and the [[Bibliography]].

- on the main page, its used as a visual divider between the short description of what the site is and the content to follow, see [[index]].
	- There, its clearly acting as a "there's a difference in content/context"
- on the bibliography page, I'm using it as divider between distinct items
	- ![[Bibliography]]
	- in this case, I wouldn't want the "book's section" to end

I was originally (per [[v0.03#Coffee Thoughts]]) thinking of using the `<hr />` to denote when to stop an embedded note's content, but since I've added the section tags for each header level, I can just break on the `</section>`.

I think for now, I'll actually ignore the `<hr />` when searching for the end of a section, and leave it as a purely visual indicator for when content/context is switching.

## Links

Okay, this is definitely going to require regex, and fortunately, there's sites like: [this one](https://regex101.com/) that let you build and test your regex. Which means its a lot easier to find the pattern of:

"contains 1\[, then letters or digits, then 1\], then 1\( letters or digits then 1\)"

or in regex:

```
\[{1}([^\[]*)\]{1}\({1}([^\)]*)\){1}
```

better explained:

- `\[{1}`: look for exactly one instance of `[`
- `([^\[]*)`: then allow any characters except for `[`
- `\]{1}`: then look for exactly one `]`
- immediately following that needs to be 1 `(`
- allow any number of characters except `)`
- end with one `)`

So, we should be able to have anything like:

`!@#$%^&{}a-zA-Z _ 0-9 [<!@#$%^&{}a-zA-Z _ 0-9 >](<!@#$%^&{}a-zA-Z _ 0-9 >) !@#$%^&{}a-zA-Z _ 0-9 `

But what currently doesn't work is something like:

`[Fetch your own forecast!](/Tutorials/Fetching%20your%20own%20Forecast%20(IPython)/index.md)`

Because of the nested `( )` in the link. Luckily, we can drop the `[^\)]` requirement and it'll adjust on the fly. So the current working regex is now:

```regex
\[{1}([^\[]*)\]{1}\({1}(.*)\){1}
```

`[Fetch your [own] forecast!](/Tutorials/Fetching%20your%20own%20Forecast%20(IPython)/index.md)`

Which means we should be able to handle that nested `[ ]` as well, and it does beautifully:

```regex
\[{1}(.*)\]{1}\({1}(.*)\){1}
```

That's a lot better than having to get really specific with the sequencing.

---

All that being said, we probably need to handle the image and internal references first, the ones that have the `!` prefix.

And... I just discovered the `substitute` functionality for regexes... This is going to make things *so* much easier.

That being said, I now need to refactor the `styling.py` code, as the current implementation is seeing the `_` in the link:

```
![small banner](/content/small_banner.png)
```

and replacing it with an `<i>` tag.

But overall, this'll be a good thing, because I can now replace while I'm matching instead of iterating the body of text twice. It's still hardcoded right now, but look how much simpler this is:

```python
def __handle_syntax(markdown_body: list[str], syntax_md: str, html_start: str, html_end: str) -> list[str]:
    for i, line in enumerate(markdown_body):
        markdown_body[i] = re.sub(syntax_md, '<img src="..\\g<link>" alt="\\g<alttext>" />', line)
    return markdown_body
```

compared to:

```python
def __handle_syntax(markdown_body, syntax_md, html_start, html_end) -> list[str]:
    syntax_length = len(syntax_md)
    for line_index, line in enumerate(markdown_body):
        start_of_block = True
        if syntax_md in line:
            words = line.split(" ")
            for i, word in enumerate(words):
                if syntax_md in word:
                    prefix = word.strip()[:syntax_length]
                    suffix = word.strip()[-syntax_length:]
                    if prefix == syntax_md and suffix == syntax_md:
                        words[i] = html_start + word[syntax_length:].replace(syntax_md, html_end)
                    elif start_of_block:
                        words[i] = word.replace(syntax_md, html_start)
                        start_of_block = False
                    else:
                        words[i] = word.replace(syntax_md, html_end)
                        start_of_block = True
            markdown_body[line_index] = " ".join(words)
    return markdown_body
```
