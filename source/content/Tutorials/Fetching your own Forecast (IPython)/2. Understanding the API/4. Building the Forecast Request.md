## Summary

What we have done:

- [x] We ask Weather.gov for grid information given our latitude and longitude
- [x] Weather.gov responds with our requested information.

Where we are at:

- [ ] **We then ask Weather.gov for the forecast (or hourly forecast) for the corresponding grid location**
- [ ] Weather.gov responds again with our request information
- [ ] We format this information to be displayed how we want

### Two Paths

>[!note]
>This section in particular might change over the next few days (relative to early January 2025) as I'm starting to rethink how to go about things.

There are two ways we can go about this, and it ultimately will depend on your use case. 

1. Build the request similar to how we did the points request
2. Just use the urls provided by the points request

For [[Programming/Project-Empyrean/index|Project Empyrean]], I (currently) only do a points request every two weeks, which means I need to build the request when ever the user wants to fetch the forecast for that day. However, one could just as easily save the preformatted requests that the points response provides. For context, I'm talking about this part:

```json
"properties": {
	...
	"cwa": "PQR",
	"forecastOffice": "https://api.weather.gov/offices/PQR",
	"gridId": "PQR",
	"gridX": 116,
	"gridY": 107,
	"forecast": "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/PQR/116,107/forecast",
	"forecastHourly": "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/PQR/116,107/forecast/hourly",
	"forecastGridData": "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/PQR/116,107",
	...
}
```

And really, I can't think any explicit benefit of creating the url ourself. I'll include it for the time being for the sake of completeness. One thing to recall is that the API documentation does recommend periodically checking your location with a points request to ensure that the grid coordinates are still valid, but for the purposes of this tutorial, we are always doing a points request before the forecast requests, so this would be a non-issue.

# Path 1: Building the urls

Structurally, we are not doing anything different than what we did back in [[3. Building a Points Request]], so a sense of familiarity is a good thing. Go ahead and add another code cell below the current one and add in two new string variables to hold the two forecast urls. While we are here, let's add them to a list and also create an empty list to store the responses.

>[!warning]
>Note the change in the url from `/points/` to `/gridpoints/` and remember `gridId` not `gridID`.

```py
forecast_url = f"https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{gridId}/{gridX},{gridY}/forecast"

forecast_hourly_url = f"https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{gridId}/{gridX},{gridY}/forecast/hourly"

forecast_urls = [ ]
forecast_urls.append(forecast_url)
forecast_urls.append(forecast_hourly_url)
forecast_response = [ ]
```

The core flow is much the same as what we have done before, but we are going to use a `for` loop to save some repeated code.

```py
for request_url in forecast_urls:
	#Add delay to prevent requesting too quickly, otherwise Weather.gov will return invalid responses
	print(f'\tWaiting 2 seconds before sending request to avoid exceeding the request limit.')
	time.sleep(2)

	response = requests.get(url=request_url)
	if response.status_code == 200:
		print("\tRequest successful.")
		forecast_response.append(response.json())
	else:
		print("\tRequest failed.")
		print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
		break
```

Things to note:

> 1. We are adding a `time.sleep()` call as an extra prevention measure to avoid sending our requests too quickly back to back to the API. Realistically, you can probably reduce the sleep time, but I like to err on the side of caution.

> 2. If you're not familiar with the `for` loop notation, you can read it in natural language more like: "for each `request_url` in the list of `forecast_urls`, do the following:". This is equivalent to:
```py
for i in range(0, len(forecast_urls)):
	request_url = forecast_urls[i]
	...
```

> 3. We are explicitly checking to make sure the first request status code evaluates to `200` (OK) and breaking out of the loop and preventing the next API call if something is wrong.

## Wrap Up

So, at the end your notebook file should now consist of three code cells:

Cell 1:
```py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
import math
import pytz
import time
  
import requests

#Optional:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

Cell 2:
```py
latitude = 45.5958
longitude = -122.6092

points_url = f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}"

response = requests.get(url=points_url)

print(response.status_code) #200 means everything worked

if response.status_code == 404:
    print("Something went wrong with requesting data. Please verify the latitude and longitude are correct before retrying.")
    print(f'\tService Error Message:\n\t\t{response.json()["detail"]}')

if response.status_code == 200:
    points_data = response.json()

    gridX = points_data["properties"]["gridX"]
    gridY = points_data["properties"]["gridY"]
    gridId = points_data["properties"]["gridId"]
```

Cell 3:
```py
forecast_url = f"https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{gridId}/{gridX},{gridY}/forecast"

forecast_hourly_url = f"https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{gridId}/{gridX},{gridY}/forecast/hourly"

forecast_urls.append(forecast_url)
forecast_urls.append(forecast_hourly_url)
forecast_response = [ ]

for request_url in forecast_urls:
	#Add delay to prevent requesting too quickly, otherwise Weather.gov will return invalid responses
	print(f'\tWaiting {time_delay} seconds before sending request to avoid exceeding the request limit.')
	time.sleep(2)

	response = requests.get(url=request_url)
	if response.status_code == 200:
		print("\tRequest successful.")
		forecast_response.append(response.json())
	else:
		print("\tRequest failed.")
		print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
		break
```

And upon execution, your notebook should look similar to mine:

# Path 2: Using what the API provides

For ease of unifying the code, I'm going to keep the same general flow as in [[#Path 1 Building the urls|Path 1]]. Go ahead and create a new cell and create the following two lists:

```py
forecast_urls = [
	points_data["properties"]["forecast"],
	points_data["properties"]["forecastHourly"]
]
forecast_response = [ ]
```

The only difference is that we are initializing the `forecast_urls` list with the two request links provided by the API in the points request:

```json
"properties": {
	...
	"cwa": "PQR",
	"forecastOffice": "https://api.weather.gov/offices/PQR",
	"gridId": "PQR",
	"gridX": 116,
	"gridY": 107,
	"forecast": "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/PQR/116,107/forecast",
	"forecastHourly": "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/PQR/116,107/forecast/hourly",
	"forecastGridData": "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/PQR/116,107",
	...
}
```

Next, we just iterate over the content in `forecast_urls`: sending a request for each url and saving the response into the `forecast_response` list:

```py
for request_url in forecast_urls:
	#Add delay to prevent requesting too quickly, otherwise Weather.gov will return invalid responses
	print(f'\tWaiting 2 seconds before sending request to avoid exceeding the request limit.')
	time.sleep(2)

	response = requests.get(url=request_url)
	if response.status_code == 200:
		print("\tRequest successful.")
		forecast_response.append(response.json())
	else:
		print("\tRequest failed.")
		print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
		break
```

This section of code is exactly the same between the two approaches. And again, things to note:

> 1. We are adding a `time.sleep()` call as an extra prevention measure to avoid sending our requests too quickly back to back to the API. Realistically, you can probably reduce the sleep time, but I like to err on the side of caution.

> 2. If you're not familiar with the `for` loop notation, you can read it in natural language more like: "for each `request_url` in the list of `forecast_urls`, do the following:". This is equivalent to:
```py
for i in range(0, len(forecast_urls)):
	request_url = forecast_urls[i]
	...
```

> 3. We are explicitly checking to make sure the first request status code evaluates to `200` (OK) and breaking out of the loop and preventing the next API call if something is wrong.

		break
