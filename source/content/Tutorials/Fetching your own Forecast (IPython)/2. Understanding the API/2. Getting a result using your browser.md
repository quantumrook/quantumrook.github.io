# Getting your Latitude and Longitude

There are a few geocoding services (turns an address/zip code into latitude and longitude) out there, but I've yet to actually hook into them. So how do we go about doing this?

Honestly, just go to [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/) and type your location into the search bar:

![[weather-gov-location.png]]

and then grab it from the forecast page:

![[weather-gov-forecast.png]]

>[!warning]
>You will need to add a negative sign to the longitude when doing the requests. 
>
>Note that in the image above, the longitude is listed as `122.60917` but in the request below I have it as `-122.6092`


# Getting gridX, gridY and gridId - The POINTS request

## Requesting from the API

- We ask (politely) for `gridX` and `gridY` that corresponds to our location (more specifically, our `latitude` and `longitude`)

If you're doing this with just your browser for this looks like:

```html
https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}
```

For example, a POINTS request for Portland, OR, looks like:

```html
https://api.weather.gov/points/45.5958,-122.6092
```

>[!warning] Something to watch out for:
> Most services, including weather.gov will give you more precision in latitude and longitude than the API uses. The API specifically requires that you only provide `4` points of precision in the request.
> 
> As an example, I have rounded `45.59578` to `45.5958` and `-122.60917` to `-122.6092`.

## Response from the API

- Weather.gov responds with a (what I'll refer to as) POINTS response that contains a variety of information about our location. Most useful to us are the `gridX`, `gridY`, and `gridId` properties listed in this `.json` document. 

You should receive something that looks like

```json
{
	"@context" : [ "..."],
	"id" : "...",
	"type" : "Feature",
	"geometry" : { "..." },
	"properties" : {
		"@id" : "...",
		"@type" : "wx:Point",
		"cwa": "<Forecast Office Name>",
		"forecastOffice" : "<Forecast Office Name>",
		"gridId": "<Grid ID>",
		"gridX": 000,
		"gridY": 000,
		...
	}
}
```

More specifically, the information we are interested in is located inside the `"properties"` key:

        "cwa": "PQR",
        "forecastOffice": "https://api.weather.gov/offices/PQR",
        "gridId": "PQR",

        "gridY": 107,
        "forecast": "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/PQR/116,107/forecast",
        "forecastHourly": "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/PQR/116,107/forecast/hourly",
        "forecastGridData": "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/PQR/116,107",
        ...
    }
```

# Getting the Forecast

## Requesting from the API

- We then ask again (politely) for the forecast using the `gridX` and `gridY` coordinates, along with the grid identifier (`gridID`).

You can either manually format the link using the style:

```html
https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{gridId}/{gridX},{gridY}/forecast
```

with your location specific information. Or you can copy and paste the link listed under the `forecast` or `forecastHourly` for either the (respective) extended or hourly forecast.

## Response from the API

- Weather.gov will then return another `.json` document containing your requested forecast.

This one contains a lot more information, both in the hourly and in the extended responses, but the same general idea applies:

- `@context` is providing general information about the response
- `geometry` gives the latitude and longitude for the polygon that represents the grid described by `gridX` and `gridY`
- `properties` contains what we are really interested in - this time, the forecast.

# Wrap Up

It might take a little bit of adjustment, but if you really just wanted to get the forecast data, you could bookmark the link

```html
https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/PQR/116,107/forecast
```

And refresh every morning to get your Portland extended forecast. The great thing is, while the response document looks big (as in a lot of content), it is only ~15 KB in size. So, if you ever have patchy internet and know your latitude and longitude in the US, you can just do a POINTS request to get your `gridX`, `gridY`, and `gridID` and then request the forecast for your location.

No extra images or webpage information to load, just nicely ordered data that requires a tiny bit of parsing.

However, the goal here is to create a script to both automate this process and to format it slightly nicer for us.
