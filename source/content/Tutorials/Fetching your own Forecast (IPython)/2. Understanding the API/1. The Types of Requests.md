The Weather.gov API provides three different types of requests that we are concerned with:

- `points`
- `forecast`
- `forecast/hourly`

The full list can be found on the API Documentation webpage located [here](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/). The documentation also does a good job at laying out the process of using the API for our needs, so if you just want the exact information, check out the "Examples" tab and click on "How do I get the forecast?"

For ease of navigation, here's the snippet:

>### How do I get the forecast?

>Forecasts are created at each [NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO)](https://www.weather.gov/srh/nwsoffices) on their own grid definition, at a resolution of about 2.5km x 2.5km. The API endpoint for the 12h forecast periods at a specific grid location is formatted as:
>
>https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{office}/{gridX},{gridY}/forecast
>
>For example: https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/TOP/31,80/forecast
>
>To obtain the grid forecast for a point location, use the /points endpoint to retrieve the current grid forecast endpoint by coordinates:
>
> https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}
>
>For example: https://api.weather.gov/points/39.7456,-97.0892
>
>This will provide the grid forecast endpoints for three format options in these properties:
>
> - forecast - forecast for 12h periods over the next seven days
> - forecastHourly - forecast for hourly periods over the next seven days
> - forecastGridData - raw forecast data over the next seven days
>
>Note: at this time coastal marine grid forecasts are only available from the forecastGridData property.
>
>Applications may cache the grid for a location to improve latency and reduce the additional lookup request; however, it is important to note that while it generally does not occur often, the gridX and gridY values (and even the office) for a given coordinate may occasionally change. For this reason, it is necessary to check back to the /points endpoint periodically for the latest office/grid mapping.
>
>The /points endpoint also contains information about the issuing office, observation stations, and zones for a given point location.

## Points

Basically, the weather service chops up regions around forecast offices and assigns them `gridX` and `gridY` coordinates. If you don't already know what those are for the location in question, you'll use a `points` request to get it.

## Forecast and Forecast/Hourly

The exact specification is located [here](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/default/gridpoint_forecast) for the extended forecast and [here](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/default/gridpoint_forecast_hourly) for the hourly forecast.

Both require the parameters of:

- `wfo`: weather forecast office
- `x`: the `gridX` parameter, obtained from the points request
- `y`: the `gridY` parameter, obtained from the points request
