Okay, the gist is (at least for the purposes we care about in this tutorial): An API is a service that we can connect to in order to request and process data.

Basically, the National Weather Service has already modeled the weather for the next few days and we would like to access that information for our specific location. So the general flow is:

- We ask Weather.gov for grid information given our latitude and longitude
- Weather.gov responds with our requested information.
- We then ask Weather.gov for the forecast (or hourly forecast) for the corresponding grid location
- Weather.gov responds again with our requested information

And how we do this is through requests and responses using their service (API).
