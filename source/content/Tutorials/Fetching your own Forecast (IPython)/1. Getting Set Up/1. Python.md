> [!todo]
>Verify python version dependency

As far as I can recall (this'll be edited once the TODO above is taken care of), we're not really using any specific features of the python language that require a specific subversion. At the time I started this project personally, [Python 3.12.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3128/) was the main release.

> If you're reading this far into the future, I doubt any critical functionality has been broken with a newer version, but just add an issue on the repo for the site and I'll work on updating things accordingly.

If you don't have any python version installed, I recommend grabbing the latest maintenance release and working with that. The installer is pretty straightforward, but I always recommend choosing the "Customize Installation" option and tweaking things from there.

>[!warning]
>Do make sure to check the option to add python to your PATH. This lets you use certain commands in the terminal/command prompt to interact with python and its helper programs like pip.

> [!todo]
> Add screenshots of a sample installation?
