There are a few options we can use to create and edit an **interactive python notebook** and it really comes down to personal choice. If you already have a favorite from past experience, go with that. If you never used a `.ipynb` file before, I'm going to recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

# VSCode

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight version of Microsoft's heavy duty **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment (IDE) of the similar name: Visual Studio.

Basically, an IDE is a program to help you write/edit source code and provides a variety of helpful services including a debugger. A lot of this is overkill for what we're doing but its nice to have for the autocomplete and syntax highlighting.

Part of the beauty of VSCode is that you can install support for (programming) languages as you need them.

# Jupyter

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is one of the main environments I've seen around the web for a while when discussions about interactive (python) notebooks come up and is pretty good in its own right.
