## What is Github?

Github is a service built around the popular development tool git. Git, itself, is a versioning control service: which, in short, means it tracks changes to files in a repository and let's you see how things change over time. 

One of the main benefits to this is the ability to roll back changes: e.g. you do a bunch of exploratory work trying a different approach to solving something only to find out it just really doesn't work. For whatever the reason "doesn't work" actually is (implementation isn't great, doesn't produce the desired outcome, etc), you can either directly roll back changes to the file or check how it was originally being done.

Perhaps phrased better, think of it as equivalent to saving "hw1.doc" and then all the different back ups you make along the way: "hw1_backup.doc", "hw1_ex1_backup.doc", etc., but this is all managed and tracked for you with commits.

> Basically, the more complicated your project becomes, the sooner you'll end up wanting some sort of version control: especially for something like writing a thesis.

It is often used to control [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") by [programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer "Programmer") who are [developing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development") software collaboratively.

>As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most [client–server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server "Client–server") systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire [repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control) "Repository (version control)"), also known as "repo", with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") access or a central [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)"). A repository is stored on each computer in a standard [directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing) "Directory (computing)") with additional, hidden files to provide version control capabilities.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#cite_note-14) Git provides features to [synchronize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_(computer_science) "Synchronization (computer science)") changes between repositories that share history; copied (cloned) from each other. For collaboration, Git supports synchronizing with repositories on [remote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") machines. Although all repositories (with the same history) are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repository to hold an integrated copy.

## Considerations

There's the saying that "the internet doesn't forget" and this is especially true with publicly hosted Git repos.

In particular, bit like this code come up later:

```py
latitude = 45.5958
longitude = -122.6092

points_url = f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}"
```

And scrubbing the fact that you committed possibly personal identifying information can be cumbersome. While this precision of latitude and longitude isn't super identifiable, you may want to preserve your anonymity: this is where `.gitignore` comes in:

Most of the time, its used to tell Git to ignore certain files that don't need to be version controlled like caches and other artifacts that occur when compiling and executing builds, but it is also great for preventing files that contain private information from being tracked.

You can view [Project Empyrean's ignore file](https://github.com/quantumrook/Project-Empyrean/blob/main/.gitignore) and see this in action. Scrolling all the way to the bottom, you'll see:

```
# Contains PII
Forecasts/*
utils/private/*
utils/json/test_data/raw_forecast.json
gui/icons/*.svg
gui/icons/*.png
gui/icons/clock/*.png
gui/icons/weather-icons-svg/*.svg
.prof_stats
profiling_stats.txt
program.prof
```

Most of this is just me preventing some profiler diagnostic files and graphic files from being included but in particular I am telling Git to ignore:

- the `Forecasts` directory and everything inside it
- the `utils/private/` directory and everything inside it

Because I have revealing information in those folders that I would prefer remain private.

>[!note] Don't worry:
>I cover how to do this when it comes up in [[3. Building a Points Request#Step 1.5 Using a private file for your location]].

> [!warning] I **strongly** recommend doing something similar for any future repos you create that ends up needing some private information about you that you don't want to have to spend a lot of time and effort trying to scrub from histories.
