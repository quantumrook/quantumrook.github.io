This section is basically to make sure we're on the page if you've strayed from the path from reading ahead.

# Step 1

![[1. Python]]

# Step 2

If you haven't already, check out [[2. Editor]] and choose what program you're going to use. Again, for the purposes of this, any screenshots and tidbits will be done with VSCode in mind.

After your editor is installed, go ahead and launch it.

## Launch VS Code

There's a few things we want to do here real quick before moving onto Step 3.

First, click the Extensions button on the sidebar `Ctrl+Shift+X` (if you're on windows) and search for "Python". The list is going to populate with a bunch of stuff, but what we're looking for is the extension created by Microsoft, should look like this:

![[python_extension.png]]

Go ahead and install this, as it basically tells VSCode that you're trying to use it for Python development. We're basically already following the steps detailed in the 'Quick Start' section on the extensions page, but feel free to look around a little bit while you're here.

> [!note]
> Now is a good time to set up the python interpreter in VSCode. Look at the section just below "Quick Start", titled "Set up your environment" and follow the instruction there to choose the version of python you have installed. There's a handy gif showing what you're looking for.

# Step 3

Now that we got Python installed and VSCode running, we can get the libraries needed to complete this project. At the top of your VSCode window, look for the menu option called "Terminal" and select "New Terminal" or use 

```
Ctrl+Shift+`
```

And then follow the steps outlined below:

![[3. Required Libraries#Built-in libraries]]

![[3. Required Libraries#Required]]

![[3. Required Libraries#Optional Libraries]]

# Step 4: Optional - Github

If you're interested, now is a great time to check out this [[4. (Optional) Github|section]] for setting up a github account and the benefits it offers.

# Wrap Up

So, at this point, you should have:

- Installed Python
- Installed VSCode (or some other editor)
- Installed the required package called `requests`
	- Optionally installed `matplotlib` and `numpy`
- Have a new `.ipynb` file with a bunch of import statements

You should have something that looks close to this:

![[imports_unresolved.png]]

The dimmed text just means we've imported them, but we haven't actually used them anywhere yet.

If you have the yellow squiggly lines like in the screenshot above, that means you either don't have the libraries installed or the interpreter can't find them just yet. Don't panic yet, click the play button at the top-left of the code cell and run it.

If it gives you an error about not being able to find the package, just run `pip` to install it and then rerun the cell when it completes.

If everything is set up right, you should have this view after running the cell:
![[imports_resolved.png]]
Now we can get into the fun stuff!
