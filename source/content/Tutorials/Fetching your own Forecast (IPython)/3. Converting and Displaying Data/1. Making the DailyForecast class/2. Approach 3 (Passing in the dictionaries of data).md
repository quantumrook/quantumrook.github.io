In effect, this is either a mixture of the first or second approach, depending on how you construct call `DailyForecast`. It is just becomes a tradeoff of "simpler call signature" versus "more complexity in `__init__`".

```py
todays_forecast = DailyForecast(date, extended_data, hourly_data)
# or
todays_forecast = DailyForecast(
	date_of_forecast=date,
	extended_forecast=extended_data,
	hourly_forecast=hourly_data
)
```

In effect, we essentially copy the code we wrote in Cell 7 (above) and reduce the need for intermediate variables. This is most likely surpasses the kind of complexity you would want inside the `__init__` function, and realistically would break up bits into logical chunks and create the corresponding functions.

```py
class DailyForecast():
	def __init__(self, date_of_forecast, extended_forecast, hourly_forecast):

		self.day_summary = ""
		self.night_summary = ""
		self.temperature_high = -273
		self.temperature_low = 273
		self.hourly_breakdown = { }

		for period in extended_forecast["properties"]["periods"]:
			period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

			if period_date != date_of_forecast:
				break

			hour, *extra = period_time.split(":")
			if int(hour) < 18:
				self.day_summary = period["detailedForecast"]
			else:
				self.night_summary = period["detailedForecast"]

		for period in hourly_forecast["properties"]["periods"]:
			period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

			if period_date != date_of_forecast:
				break

            hour, *extra = period_time.split(":")
			speed, unit = period["windSpeed"].split(" ")
			temperature = int(period["temperature"])

			self.hourly_breakdown[hour] = {
				"temperature" : temperature,
				"windchill" : 0, #We'll get to calculating this later
				"chance_of_rain" : period["probabilityOfPrecipitation"]["value"],
				"wind_speed": speed
			}

			if temperature > self.high:
				self.high = temperature
			if temperature < self.low:
				self.low = temperature
```

Since the logic is already chunked by the type of data we are passing in, we can use that as our guide for chunking it off:

```py
class DailyForecast():

	def __init__(self, date_of_forecast, extended_forecast, hourly_forecast):

		#Initialize our variables
		self.day_summary = ""
		self.night_summary = ""
		self.temperature_high = -273
		self.temperature_low = 273
		self.hourly_breakdown = { }

		#Populate our day and night summaries using the extended forecast data
		self.__get_summaries_from_data(
			date_of_forecast=date_of_forecast,
			extended_forecast=extended_forecast
        )

		#Create our hourly breakdown and record the highest and lowest temperatures
		self.__build_hourly_breakdown(
			date_of_forecast=date_of_forecast,
			hourly_forecast=hourly_forecast
		)

	def __get_summaries_from_data(self, date_of_forecast, extended_forecast):

		for period in extended_forecast["properties"]["periods"]:
			period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

			if period_date != date_of_forecast:
				break

			hour, *extra = period_time.split(":")
			if int(hour) < 18:
				self.day_summary = period["detailedForecast"]
			else:
				self.night_summary = period["detailedForecast"]

	def __build_hourly_breakdown(self, date_of_forecast, hourly_forecast):

		for period in hourly_forecast["properties"]["periods"]:
			period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

			if period_date != date_of_forecast:
				break

			hour, *extra = period_time.split(":")
			speed, unit = period["windSpeed"].split(" ")
			temperature = int(period["temperature"])

			self.hourly_breakdown[hour] = {
				"temperature" : temperature,
				"windchill" : 0, #We'll get to calculating this later
				"chance_of_rain" : period["probabilityOfPrecipitation"]["value"],
				"wind_speed": speed
			}

			if temperature > self.high:
				self.high = temperature
			if temperature < self.low:
				self.low = temperature
```

>The use of `__` as a prefix to each function name is to signal to other users of this class (potentially yourself later on) that the function is intended to be used internally. As in, "Hey, you shouldn't ever be calling this outside of the class itself, and if you are, you might break things. Ye have been warned."

Generally speaking, you want to write self descriptive code that creates a narrative as you read it. `self.__get_summaries_from_data()` does this fairly well for setting the context of what you are going to do. Nitpicking my own writing:

- I would recommend probably changing the name to `__set_summaries_from_data`, as `get` typically means that the function is going to return a value.
- `__build_hourly_breakdown()` could probably be named better, as it does not give any clue that we are also setting the values of `temperature_high` and `temperature_low` inside of it. This is only hinted at because of the comment above the function call inside `__init__`. 
	- We could instead be explicit and rename it to `__build_hourly_breakdown_and_set_high_and_low`, which I'd normally advocate for being self-descriptive as it doesn't cost us anything to write a longer function name. However, there does eventually become a tradeoff in legibility as these things get longer.
	- One alternative is to brainstorm a better name that is more concise, which can be tricky (and sometimes time consuming).
	- Another alternative is to make setting the extreme temperatures its own function. In **this** use case, iterating over the data isn't too expensive (in terms of time and compute power), but for bigger data sets, you might sacrifice some explicit clarity for performance.

To give you an idea of what the separate function looks like, I would probably do the following:

```py
def __record_temperature_extremes(self, date_of_forecast, hourly_forecast):
	for period in hourly_forecast["properties"]["periods"]:
		period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

		if period_date != date_of_forecast:
			break

		temperature = int(period["temperature"])
	
		if temperature > self.high:
			self.high = temperature
	
		if temperature < self.low:
			self.low = temperature
```

>[!note]
>One of the things that you'll discover in processes like this is that there ends up being a common parameter you pass around, and in this case it is `date_of_forecast`. Thinking about it, that would probably be a nice thing to be able to reference later on.
>
>The natural extension of making this class is not to just hold today's forecast, but to also convert the rest of the forecast data into instances of `DailyForecast`, and if we have a list of these instances - it would be very helpful to know which day the forecast is for.
>
>So, with that being said, I will also add a `date` property to the class inside `__init__` as shown in the class description below. And since it is an instance variable now, the function signatures can change to omit passing this parameter along and just reference the value instead.

such that the class now looks like:

```py
class DailyForecast():

	def __init__(self, date_of_forecast, extended_forecast, hourly_forecast):

		#Initialize our variables
		self.date = date_of_forecast
		self.day_summary = ""
		self.night_summary = ""
		self.temperature_high = -273
		self.temperature_low = 273
		self.hourly_breakdown = { }

		#Populate our day and night summaries using the extended forecast data
		self.__get_summaries_from_data(
			extended_forecast=extended_forecast
		)

		#Create our hourly breakdown
		self.__build_hourly_breakdown(
			hourly_forecast=hourly_forecast
		)

		#Record the highest and lowest temperatures

		self.__record_temperature_extremes(
			hourly_forecast=hourly_forecast
		)

	def __get_summaries_from_data(self, extended_forecast):

		for period in extended_forecast["properties"]["periods"]:
			period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

			if period_date != self.date:
				break

			hour, *extra = period_time.split(":")

			if int(hour) < 18:
				self.day_summary = period["detailedForecast"]
			else:
				self.night_summary = period["detailedForecast"]

	def __build_hourly_breakdown(self, hourly_forecast):

		for period in hourly_forecast["properties"]["periods"]:
			period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

			if period_date != self.date:
				break

			hour, *extra = period_time.split(":")
			speed, unit = period["windSpeed"].split(" ")

			self.hourly_breakdown[hour] = {
				"temperature" : int(period["temperature"]),
				"windchill" : 0, #We'll get to calculating this later
				"chance_of_rain" : period["probabilityOfPrecipitation"]["value"],
				"wind_speed": speed
			}

	def __record_temperature_extremes(self, hourly_forecast):

		for period in hourly_forecast["properties"]["periods"]:
			period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

			if period_date != self.date:
				break

			temperature = int(period["temperature"])

			if temperature > high:
				self.temperature_high = temperature
			if temperature < low:
				self.temperature_low = temperature
```
