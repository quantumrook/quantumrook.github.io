## Approach 1: Positional Arguments

What this means is that the names of the variables we use don't matter, but the order in which we put them inside `DailyForecast( ... )` does.

For example, I am going to structure `__init__` with the assumption that we will pass in the data in the order that we defined the variables inside the class:

```py
class DailyForecast(): # This tells python we are defining what the class is going to look like
	def __init__(self, day_summary, night_summary, temperature_high, temperature_low, hourly_breakdown):
	# This function is called when we create a new instance of the class like: todays_forecast = DailyForecast().
		self.day_summary = day_summary
		self.night_summary = night_summary
		self.temperature_high = temperature_high
		self.tempearture_low = tempearture_low
		self.hourly_breakdown = hourly_breakdown
```

Then, assuming we have already grabbed the information, we would construct our new instance like:

```py
todays_forecast = DailyForecast(day, night, high, low, hour_forecast)
```

Now this doesn't mean you should never take this approach, it is just something you should be aware of. The same thing can happen with the *by keyword* if you are not paying enough attention to what you are writing.

## Approach 2: Keyword Arguments

This approach is a bit more explicit in the assignment, as we specify the arguments name before placing the value. The structure of `__init__` remains unchanged, just how we call `DailyForecast`:

```py
todays_forecast = DailyForecast(
	day_summary=day,
	night_summary=night,
	temperature_high=high,
	temperature_low=low,
	hourly_breakdown=hour_forecast
)
```

Personally, this is the approach I use all over the place, as it forces me to take the extra step to think about what is going where and helps create self documentation on what my thought process was/assumptions were.

## Approaches 1 & 2: Getting the Data

Ultimately, either way we go, we still need to iterate over both `hourly_data` and `extended_data` to populate our `DailyForecast` with information. Starting with the `hourly_forecast` we can create our `hourly_breakdown` dictionary:

```py
todays_hourly_breakdown = { }

high = -273
low = 273

for period in hourly_data["properties"]["periods"]:
	period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

	if period_date != today:
		break

	hour, *extra = period_time.split(":")
	speed, unit = period["windSpeed"].split(" ")
	temperature = int(period["temperature"])

	todays_hourly_breakdown[hour] = {
		"temperature" : temperature,
		"windchill" : 0, #We'll get to calculating this later
		"chance_of_rain" : period["probabilityOfPrecipitation"]["value"],
		"wind_speed": speed
	}

	if temperature > high:
		high = temperature
	if temperature < low:
		low = temperature
```

For clarity, I've opted to do this in a new cell, preserving what we did in the past. I have also introduced two variables to capture the highest and lowest temperatures for the day. Next we just need to grab the summary for the two twelve hour periods from `extended_data`. If you recall, the extended forecast gave us the `.json` structured like:

```json
{
    "@context": [ "..."],
    "type": "Feature",
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [ "..." ]
    },
    "properties": {
        "..." : "...",
        "periods": [
            {
                "number": 1,
                "name": "Today",
                "startTime": "2025-01-05T10:00:00-07:00",
                "endTime": "2025-01-05T18:00:00-07:00",
                "isDaytime": true,
                "temperature": 28,
                "temperatureUnit": "F",
                "temperatureTrend": "",
                "probabilityOfPrecipitation": {
                    "unitCode": "wmoUnit:percent",
                    "value": null
                },
                "windSpeed": "6 mph",
                "windDirection": "ESE",
                "icon": "https://api.weather.gov/icons/land/day/sct?size=medium",
                "shortForecast": "Mostly Sunny",
                "detailedForecast": "Mostly sunny. High near 28, with temperatures falling to around 26 in the afternoon. East southeast wind around 6 mph."
            },
```

which we grab by:

```py
extended_data = forecast_response[0]

day_summary = ""
night_summary = ""

for period in extended_data["properties"]["periods"]:
	period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

	if period_date != today:
		break
    
	hour, *extra = period_time.split(":")
	if int(hour) <= 12:
		day_summary = period["detailedForecast"]
	else:
		night_summary = period["detailedForecast"]
```

Then, we can pass everything into the constructor to build our new instance:

```py
todays_forecast = DailyForecast(
	day_summary=day_summary,
	night_summary=night_summary,
	temperature_high=high,
	temperature_low=low,
	hourly_breakdown=todays_hourly_breakdown
)
```

And finally format some output:

```py
print("Today's Forecast")
print(f"High: {todays_forecast.temperature_high}, Low: {todays_forecast.temperature_low}\n")

print(f"Today:")
print(f"\t{todays_forecast.day_summary}")

for hour, hourly_data in todays_forecast.hourly_breakdown.items():
	if int(hour) < 18 and int(hour) > 6:
		print(f"{hour}: {hourly_data["temperature"]}\N{DEGREE SIGN}F with {hourly_data["chance_of_rain"]}% chance of rain.")

print(f"\nThis Evening:")
print(f"\t{todays_forecast.night_summary}")

for hour, hourly_data in todays_forecast.hourly_breakdown.items():
	if int(hour) >= 18:
		print(f"{hour}: {hourly_data["temperature"]}\N{DEGREE SIGN}F with {hourly_data["chance_of_rain"]}% chance of rain.")
```

>[!note]
>The key of `hour` is stored as a string (or text), which means we need to first convert it to a numerical type before we can compare it, like in:
>
>`if int(hour) < 18 and int(hour) > 6:`
>
>This reads as "convert hour to an integer, then check if it is less than 18 and bigger than 6".

Which gives us the following output:

```
Today's Forecast
High: 53, Low: 49

Today:
	Rain likely. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 53. Southeast wind around 5 mph. Chance of precipitation is 60%. New rainfall amounts between a tenth and quarter of an inch possible.
11: 51°F with 16% chance of rain.
12: 51°F with 17% chance of rain.
13: 52°F with 22% chance of rain.
14: 52°F with 33% chance of rain.
15: 53°F with 58% chance of rain.
16: 51°F with 32% chance of rain.
17: 52°F with 43% chance of rain.

This Evening:
	Rain before 4am, then a slight chance of rain showers. Cloudy. Low around 44, with temperatures rising to around 46 overnight. East wind around 6 mph. Chance of precipitation is 80%. New rainfall amounts between a quarter and half of an inch possible.
18: 51°F with 64% chance of rain.
19: 50°F with 79% chance of rain.
20: 50°F with 80% chance of rain.
21: 49°F with 75% chance of rain.
22: 49°F with 55% chance of rain.
23: 49°F with 54% chance of rain.
```

>[!note]
>There's (technically) missing data in my example output, because at the time of writing, it was 10 am, and the `hourly_data` returned doesn't contain the hourly forecast for the previous hours.

## Wrap up

You should have four new cells at the end of your notebook:

Cell 5: Optional, just a separator between the first part of the tutorial
```markdown
## Using Classes
```

Cell 6: The class definition
```py
class DailyForecast():

	def __init__(self, day_summary, night_summary, high, low, hourly_breakdown):
		self.day_summary = day_summary
		self.night_summary = night_summary
		self.temperature_high = high
		self.temperature_low = low
		self.hourly_breakdown = hourly_breakdown
```

Cell 7: Getting the data and constructing our instance `todays_forecast` of `DailyForecast`
```py
todays_hourly_breakdown = { }

high = -273
low = 273

for period in hourly_data["properties"]["periods"]:
	period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

	if period_date != today:
		break

	hour, *extra = period_time.split(":")
	speed, unit = period["windSpeed"].split(" ")
	temperature = int(period["temperature"])

	todays_hourly_breakdown[hour] = {
		"temperature" : temperature,
		"windchill" : 0, #We'll get to calculating this later
		"chance_of_rain" : period["probabilityOfPrecipitation"]["value"],
		"wind_speed": speed
	}

	if temperature > high:
		high = temperature
	if temperature < low:
		low = temperature

extended_data = forecast_response[0]

day_summary = ""
night_summary = ""

for period in extended_data["properties"]["periods"]:
	period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

	if period_date != today:
		break

	hour, *extra = period_time.split(":")
	if int(hour) < 18:
		day_summary = period["detailedForecast"]
	else:
		night_summary = period["detailedForecast"]

todays_forecast = DailyForecast(
	day_summary=day_summary,
	night_summary=night_summary,
	high=high,
	low=low,
	hourly_breakdown=todays_hourly_breakdown
)
```

And Cell 8: Which prints out the forecast using our new class
```py
print("Today's Forecast")
print(f"High: {todays_forecast.temperature_high}, Low: {todays_forecast.temperature_low}\n")

print(f"Today:")
print(f"\t{todays_forecast.day_summary}")

for hour, hourly_data in todays_forecast.hourly_breakdown.items():
	if int(hour) < 18 and int(hour) > 6:
		print(f"{hour}: {hourly_data["temperature"]}\N{DEGREE SIGN}F with {hourly_data["chance_of_rain"]}% chance of rain.")

print(f"\nThis Evening:")
print(f"\t{todays_forecast.night_summary}")

for hour, hourly_data in todays_forecast.hourly_breakdown.items():
	if int(hour) >= 18:
		print(f"{hour}: {hourly_data["temperature"]}\N{DEGREE SIGN}F with {hourly_data["chance_of_rain"]}% chance of rain.")
```
