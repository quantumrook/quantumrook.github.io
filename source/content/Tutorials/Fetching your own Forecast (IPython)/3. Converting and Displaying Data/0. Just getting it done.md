At its core, we now have everything and this starts to become more free form:

- Which forecast do you want to display the data of?
- How much formatting do you want to do?
- What properties of the forecast are you interested in?
- etc.

But, to conclude things as promised, we will go through the hourly forecast and get the temperature and chance of rain for each hour for the current day. Revisiting the example forecast for Portland, OR (with some content snipped):

}
```

The `"periods"` key contains a list of the forecast data for each hour. To make things a bit more straightforward, let us grab a copy of the hourly data:

```py
hourly_data = forecast_response[1]
```

Now, since we've already called `response.json()` when appending to the `forecast_response` list, `hourly_data` is already formatted as a dictionary of dictionaries. To begin, we want to access the `"periods"` key and iterate over the content. Remember that `"periods"` is nested under `"properties"`, so the `for` loop will have a chained call:

```py
for period in hourly_data["properties"]["periods"]:
	...
```

With the benefit of hindsight, I know that the hourly forecast actually ranges out beyond just today's data, so above the `for` loop, we want to grab a copy of today's date using the `datetime` library. 

>[!note] 
>We could also hardcode today's date and just pattern match, but then you're relying on remembering to update the string every new day you want the forecast.

```py
today_as_dt = datetime.today()
today_as_str = datetime.strftime(today_as_dt, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

And if we print the output, we get:

```
2025-01-04
```

We can actually simplify this by chaining the calls:

```py
today = datetime.strftime(datetime.today(), "%Y-%m-%d")
```

Now that we have today's date, we just need to parse the `startTime` value into the same format we are comparing against; namely, we only care about the date value, not the time code that is present:

```json
"startTime": "2025-01-04T10:00:00-08:00"
```

The most straightforward way of doing this, in my opinion, is to call the `.split()` method on the string.

> [!info] How `.split()` works:
> We supply a character (or letter in this case) for the function to look for in the provided string. In our case, everything past `T` deals with time, which we are not concerned with.
> 
> So, `"2025-01-04T10:00:00-08:00".split("T")` will:
> 
> - take the string and look for any instance of `T`
> - return a list of strings that were separated by `T`
> 
> In our case, there's only one `T` present, so we will get back a list of the form: `["2025-01-04", "10:00:00-08:00"]`

Returning to the `for` loop, let us create a variable to hold the output we want:

```py
for period in hourly_data["properties"]["periods"]:
	period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

	if period_date != today:
		break
```

While its not an essential optimization, what we are doing is ending the loop early once we reach data that is no longer relevant to today. It's important to note that we can do this because the data is sorted chronologically for us. Now to get some actual data on the screen, let's put in some print statements - feel free to go wild here, as what you're interested in may differ.

```py
for period in hourly_data["properties"]["periods"]:
	period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

	if period_date != today:
		break
	print(f"\t{period_time}: {period["temperature"]} F,\t {period["probabilityOfPrecipitation"]["value"]} %")
```

Which will give something like:

```
	06:00:00-08:00: 45 F,	 17 %
	07:00:00-08:00: 45 F,	 18 %
	08:00:00-08:00: 45 F,	 18 %
	09:00:00-08:00: 46 F,	 28 %
	10:00:00-08:00: 46 F,	 40 %
	11:00:00-08:00: 47 F,	 62 %
	12:00:00-08:00: 48 F,	 82 %
	13:00:00-08:00: 48 F,	 89 %
	14:00:00-08:00: 49 F,	 93 %
	15:00:00-08:00: 50 F,	 97 %
	16:00:00-08:00: 49 F,	 99 %
	17:00:00-08:00: 49 F,	 94 %
	18:00:00-08:00: 49 F,	 80 %
	19:00:00-08:00: 49 F,	 69 %
	20:00:00-08:00: 49 F,	 61 %
	21:00:00-08:00: 49 F,	 56 %
	22:00:00-08:00: 49 F,	 56 %
	23:00:00-08:00: 49 F,	 51 %
```

Awesome! It could use some refinement in how it is displayed, but you are successfully getting today's hourly forecast!

>[!note]- How Markdown Tables are Structured:
>
> Markdown is a lightweight formatting language for displaying texts (this site is written in it!). The gist is that we define a table through a series of `|` characters. For our purposes, each table uses the first row as the headers for the table:
> 
> `| Time | Temperature | Chance of Rain |`
> 
> This tells markdown to create 3 columns with the respective headers. The following line is used to describe how to align the content in each column. This [link](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Advanced+formatting+syntax#Tables) goes into more detail, if you want to customize your own version to taste.
> 
> `| :--: | :--: | :--: |`
> 
> This translates to: "center align the content". Note that the columns don't need to be the same width as the header row, the table will automatically format each column to the width of the biggest item.
> 
> And from there, we just add each row's content inside each pair of `|`:
> 
> `| This is row 1, column 1 | This is row 1, column 2 | this is row 1, column 3|`
> `| This is row 2, column 1 | This is row 2, column 2 | this is row 2, column 3|`
>
> Which, when put together, creates the following table:
>
>| Time | Temperature | Chance of Rain |
>| :--: | :--: | :--: |
>| This is row 1, column 1 | This is row 1, column 2 | this is row 1, column 3|
>| This is row 2, column 1 | This is row 2, column 2 | this is row 2, column 3|


This part largely comes to taste on how exactly you would want to format your table. I have opted to go for something that looks like:

| Time | Temperature | Chance of Rain % |
| :--: | :---------: | :--------------: |
| 00:00 |  00 | 0  |

which, in markdown looks like:

```markdown
| Time  | Temperature | Chance of Rain % |
| :---: | :---------: | :--------------: |
| 00:00 |  00         |        0         |
```

And is easy to recreate with some `print` statements. The full cell looks like this:

```py
hourly_data = forecast_response[1]
today = datetime.strftime(datetime.today(), "%Y-%m-%d")

print("### Today's Hourly Forecast")
print("| Time | Temperature (\N{DEGREE SIGN}F) | Chance of Rain (%)|")
print("| :--: | :---------: | :------------: |")

for period in hourly_data["properties"]["periods"]:
    period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")
    
    if period_date != today:
        break

    hour, minute, *extra = period_time.split(":")
    print(f"| {hour}:{minute} | {period["temperature"]} | {period["probabilityOfPrecipitation"]["value"]} |")
```

and gives the raw output of:

```markdown
### Today's Hourly Forecast
| Time | Temperature (°F) | Chance of Rain (%)|
| :--: | :---------: | :------------: |
| 06:00 | 45 | 17 |
| 07:00 | 45 | 18 |
| 08:00 | 45 | 18 |
| 09:00 | 46 | 28 |
| 10:00 | 46 | 40 |
| 11:00 | 47 | 62 |
| 12:00 | 48 | 82 |
| 13:00 | 48 | 89 |
| 14:00 | 49 | 93 |
| 15:00 | 50 | 97 |
| 16:00 | 49 | 99 |
| 17:00 | 49 | 94 |
| 18:00 | 49 | 80 |
| 19:00 | 49 | 69 |
| 20:00 | 49 | 61 |
| 21:00 | 49 | 56 |
| 22:00 | 49 | 56 |
| 23:00 | 49 | 51 |
```

which renders as:

### Today's Hourly Forecast

| Time | Temperature (°F) | Chance of Rain (%)|
| :--: | :---------: | :------------: |
| 06:00 | 45 | 17 |
| 07:00 | 45 | 18 |
| 08:00 | 45 | 18 |
| 09:00 | 46 | 28 |
| 10:00 | 46 | 40 |
| 11:00 | 47 | 62 |
| 12:00 | 48 | 82 |
| 13:00 | 48 | 89 |
| 14:00 | 49 | 93 |
| 15:00 | 50 | 97 |
| 16:00 | 49 | 99 |
| 17:00 | 49 | 94 |
| 18:00 | 49 | 80 |
| 19:00 | 49 | 69 |
| 20:00 | 49 | 61 |
| 21:00 | 49 | 56 |
| 22:00 | 49 | 56 |
| 23:00 | 49 | 51 |

The only significant step was the inclusion of the line:

```py
hour, minute, *extra = period_time.split(":")
```

Where I'm unpacking the result of splitting `06:00:00-08:00` on each `:` into the list `[06, 00, 00-08, 00]`. The first two values of the list are assigned to `hour` and `minute` respectively and the rest of the list is assigned to `extra`.

And there you go: a complete script from start to finish that fetches your location's forecast and gives you a nice table for what the day looks like - ready to be copy-pasted into something like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for your daily notes.

If you're interested in taking things a few steps further, feel free to poke around to topic areas that interest you, and if you found this helpful, please feel free to spread it around.

As of the time of writing, there's not too much else currently on here, but do check back as I have some more tutorials in the works and much more content to add both in the Notes section and in the active projects.

-- Take care!

# Wrap Up

Here's each cell we created all in one place for ease of reference. The only changes I have made to it are removing two import statements (the `dataclasses`, `math`, and `pytz` libraries), since we did not use them in this version, as well as trimming the `gridX`, `gridY`, and `gridId` variables, as I am opting to use [[4. Building the Forecast Request#Path 2 Using what the API provides|Path 2: Using what the API provides]] approach as it is slightly cleaner.

Below all of the cells is a screenshot of the notebook I used alongside writing the tutorial, if you find that kind of comparison easier.

Cell 1:
```py
from datetime import datetime
import time

import requests

#Optional:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

Cell 2:
```py
latitude = 45.5958
longitude = -122.6092

points_url = f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}"

response = requests.get(url=points_url)

print(response.status_code) #200 means everything worked
if response.status_code == 404:
    print("Something went wrong with requesting data. Please verify the latitude and longitude are correct before retrying.")
    print(f'\tService Error Message:\n\t\t{response.json()["detail"]}')

if response.status_code == 200:
    points_data = response.json()
```

Cell 3:
```py
forecast_urls = [
    points_data["properties"]["forecast"],
    points_data["properties"]["forecastHourly"]
]

forecast_response = [ ]

for request_url in forecast_urls:
    #Add delay to prevent requesting too quickly, otherwise Weather.gov will return invalid responses
    print(f'\tWaiting 2 seconds before sending request to avoid exceeding the request limit.')
    time.sleep(2)

    response = requests.get(url=request_url)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("\tRequest successful.")
        forecast_response.append(response.json())
    else:
        print("\tRequest failed.")
        print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
        break
```

Cell 4:
```py
hourly_data = forecast_response[1]
today = datetime.strftime(datetime.today(), "%Y-%m-%d")

print("## Today's Hourly Forecast")
print("| Time | Temperature (\N{DEGREE SIGN}F) | Chance of Rain (%)|")
print("| :--: | :---------: | :------------: |")

for period in hourly_data["properties"]["periods"]:
    period_date, period_time = period["startTime"].split("T")

    if period_date != today:
        break

    hour, minute, *extra = period_time.split(":")
    print(f"| {hour}:{minute} | {period["temperature"]} | {period["probabilityOfPrecipitation"]["value"]} |")
```
