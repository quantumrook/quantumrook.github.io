Each step is broken down by logical dependency: e.g., you need an editor before you can do anything else, etc. If I've done this correctly, you should be able to skip to relevant parts if you're more experienced.

1. Getting Set up
	1. Editor
	2. Python
	3. Required Libraries
	4. Optional: Github
2. Understanding the API
	1. Getting a result using your browser
	2. Types of Requests
	3. Building a Request using the `requests` library
3. Converting and Displaying the Data
	1. Making the `ForecastData` dataclass
	2. Adding Helper functions (for conversion)
	3. Formatting the output text
4. Optional: Taking things one step further
	1. Creating a temperature plot with `matplotlib`
	2. Saving the output into a markdown file
5. Appendix: Using a `.py` file instead of an IPython Notebook
