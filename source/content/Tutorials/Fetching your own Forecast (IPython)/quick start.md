This is for the "just show me the code and I want to learn by tweaking" type of person. This features the IPython Notebook file discussed in the other sections and a brief blurb to get you off the ground and running with fetching your own forecast.

Link to the Notebook in the repo [here](https://github.com/quantumrook/quantumrook.github.io/blob/main/source/content/Tutorials/Fetching%20your%20own%20Forecast%20(IPython)/Forecaster.ipynb).
