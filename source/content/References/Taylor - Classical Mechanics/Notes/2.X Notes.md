# 2.1 Air Resistance

## Quick Reference

- Drag is proportional to velocity with two major terms to consider:
	- Linear term, which dominates for baseball-like objects
	- Quadratic term, which dominates for small oildrop-like objects
- Use the following ratio to see which term can often be neglected
![[2.X Notes#^eed928]]
- where $\gamma$ is given by [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient) and $\beta$ is [this](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/airfri.html#c3)

## Long Summary

The resistive [[force]], [[drag]], is proportional to the [[velocity]] and in **most** cases, points in the opposite direction of the object's velocity as describe by Equation (2.1):

![[2.1 Air Resistance#^fcd5d5]]

This function, $f(v)$, is assumed to be well-behaved such that a [[Taylor expansion]] is possible, allowing us to consider just the linear and quadratic terms (the constant term $a$ must be zero, as their is no drag when $v=0$.):

![[2.1 Air Resistance#^dc6094]]

The coefficients relate to the [[viscosity]] of the [[medium]] in which the object is traveling and it's [[cross-sectional area]]:

![[2.1 Air Resistance#^e15853]]
![[2.1 Air Resistance#^46cdee]]

Typically, we can neglect one of the terms ($f_{lin}$ or $f_{quad}$), and we can figure out which term is more significant by examining their ratio:

$$\frac{f_{quad}}{f_{lin}} = \frac{cv^2}{bv} = \frac{\gamma D}{\beta}v$$ ^eed928

The following example explores what type of spherical objects have different terms that dominate, a baseball, raindrop, and oildrop:

In short:

| Object        | Neglects  | Form                                    |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Baseball-like | linear    | $\textbf{f}=-cv^2\hat{\textbf{v}}$      |
| Raindrop-like | neither   | $\textbf{f}=-(bv+cv^2)\hat{\textbf{v}}$ |
| Oildrop-like  | quadratic | $\textbf{f}=-bv\hat{\textbf{v}}$        |
